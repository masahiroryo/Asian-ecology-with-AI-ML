Title = {Applying computer vision to digitised natural history collections for
   climate change research: Temperature-size responses in British
   butterflies},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Abstract = {Natural history collections are invaluable resources for understanding
   biotic response to global change. Museums around the world are currently
   imaging specimens, capturing specimen data and making them freely
   available online. In parallel to the digitisation effort, there have
   been great advancements in computer vision: the computer trained
   automated recognition/detection, and measurement of features in digital
   images. Applying computer vision to digitised natural history
   collections has the potential to greatly accelerate the use of these
   collections for biotic response to global change research. In this
   paper, we apply computer vision to a very large, digitised collection to
   test hypotheses in an established area of biotic response to climate
   change research: temperature-size responses. We develop a computer
   vision pipeline (Mothra) and apply it to the NHM collection of British
   butterflies (>180,000 imaged specimens). Mothra automatically detects
   the specimen and other objects in the image, sets the scale, measures
   wing features (e.g. forewing length), determines the orientation of the
   specimen (pinned ventrally or dorsally) and identifies the sex. We pair
   these measurements and specimen collection data with temperature records
   for 17,726 specimens across a subset of 24 species to test how adult
   size varies with temperature during the immature stages of species. We
   also assess patterns of sexual size dimorphism across species and
   families for 32 species trained for automated sex ID. Mothra accurately
   measures the forewing lengths of butterfly specimens compared to manual
   measurements and accurately determines the sex of specimens, with
   females as the larger sex in most species. An increase in adult body
   size with warmer monthly temperatures during the late larval stages is
   the most common temperature-size response. These results confirm
   suspected patterns and support hypotheses based on recent studies using
   a smaller dataset of manually measured specimens. We show that computer
   vision can be a powerful tool to efficiently and accurately extract
   phenotypic data from a very large collection of digital natural history
   collections. In the future, computer vision will become widely applied
   to digital collections to advance ecological and evolutionary research
   and to accelerate their use to investigate biotic response to global
   change.},

Title = {Mapping mangrove leaf area index (LAI) by combining remote sensing
   images with PROSAIL-D and XGBoost methods},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a vital parameter reflecting vegetation
   structure, physioecological process and growth development. Accurate
   estimation of mangrove LAI is fundamental for assessing the ecological
   restoration and sustainable development of mangrove ecosystems. To date,
   very few studies have explored the hybrid method of radiative transfer
   model (RTM) and machine-learning model in retrieving mangrove LAI with
   different satellite sensors. This study investigated the capabilities of
   combining the PROSAIL-D model, XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) and
   remote sensing images in estimating mangrove LAI, considering the
   spatial resolutions and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) of Landsat-8,
   Sentinel-2, Worldview-2 and Zhuhai-1 images, and further explored the
   role of eco-environmental factors in the spatial distribution of LAI in
   Gaoqiao Mangrove Reserve, China. The results showed that the Zhuhai-1
   acquires the best estimation accuracy (R-Val(2) (the determination
   coefficient of validation) = 0.86, RPD (residual prediction deviation) =
   3.36 and RMSE (root mean square error) = 0.31), followed by Worldview-2
   (R-Val(2) = 0.84, RPD = 2.64 and RMSE = 0.33), Sentinel-2 (R-Val(2) =
   0.34, RPD = 1.33 and RMSE = 0.62) and Landsat-8 (R-Val(2) = 0.29, RPD =
   1.03 and RMSE = 0.71). The newly developed three-band VIs ((B-443 -
   B-864) / {[} (B-443 + B-864) - 2 x B-561] with Landsat-8, (B-490 -
   B-842) / {[}(B-490 + B-842) - 2 x B-705] with Sentinel-2, (B-427 -
   B-832) / (B-908 - B-832) with Worldview-2 and (B-896 - B-700) / (B-776 -
   B-700) with Zhuhai-1) were efficient estimators of mangrove LAI.
   Moreover, elevation and species composition could greatly affect the
   spatial distribution of mangrove LAI. We concluded that the hybrid
   method of PROSAIL-D and XGBoost model using VIs derived from Zhuhai-1
   hyperspectral image could be deemed as basic method and input variables
   of mapping mangrove LAI, and could be effectively and widely applied in
   generating mangrove LAI products at the regional and national scales.},

Title = {Seabird surveillance: combining CCTV and artificial intelligence for
   monitoring and research},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Abstract = {Ecological research and monitoring need to be able to rapidly convey
   information that can form the basis of scientifically sound management.
   Automated sensor systems, especially if combined with artificial
   intelligence, can contribute to such rapid high-resolution data
   retrieval. Here, we explore the prospects of automated methods to
   generate insights for seabirds, which are often monitored for their high
   conservation value and for being sentinels for marine ecosystem changes.
   We have developed a system of video surveillance combined with automated
   image processing, which we apply to common murres Uria aalge. The system
   uses a deep learning algorithm for object detection (YOLOv5) that has
   been trained on annotated images of adult birds, chicks and eggs, and
   outputs time, location, size and confidence level of all detections,
   frame-by-frame, in the supplied video material. A total of 144 million
   bird detections were generated from a breeding cliff over three complete
   breeding seasons (2019-2021). We demonstrate how object detection can be
   used to accurately monitor breeding phenology and chick growth. Our
   automated monitoring approach can also identify and quantify rare events
   that are easily missed in traditional monitoring, such as disturbances
   from predators. Further, combining automated video analysis with
   continuous measurements from a temperature logger allows us to study
   impacts of heat waves on nest attendance in high detail. Our automated
   system thus produces comparable, and in several cases significantly more
   detailed, data than those generated from observational field studies. By
   running in real time on the camera streams, it has the potential to
   supply researchers and managers with high-resolution up-to-date
   information on seabird population status. We describe how the system can
   be modified to fit various types of ecological research and monitoring
   goals and thereby provide up-to-date support for conservation and
   ecosystem management.},

Title = {Assortative mixing in eastern spadefoot (Scaphiopus holbrookii) spatial
   networks is driven by landscape features},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Biotic and abiotic factors drive assortative mixing (preference for or
   sorting with individuals with similar characteristics) in animal
   populations on a landscape, with implications for dispersal, population
   structuring, and other ecological and evolutionary processes. However,
   patterns and generative mechanisms of assortative mixing are overlooked
   in amphibians outside of specific life history events such as
   reproduction. The aims of this project were to determine whether there
   is assortative mixing by size and life history category in eastern
   spadefoots (Scaphiopus holbrookii), whether these patterns are preserved
   across time and spatial scale, and quantify the nature and relative role
   of various habitat and soil features in explaining observed patterns in
   spatial organization of individuals. We conducted field surveys in
   southeastern Virginia, USA, in 2016 and 2017 during nonbreeding periods
   to create spatial networks of S. holbrookii. We quantified spatial
   assortativity by size and life history stage and evaluated the roles of
   multiple landscape features in explaining spatial organization of S.
   holbrookii. We found that S. holbrookii sorted spatially by size and sex
   outside of breeding periods, with juveniles and adults less likely to
   sort with each other. Within each life history stage, S. holbrookii
   sorted by size. These patterns were similar across time and spatial
   scale. Soil and habitat types had no effect on assortativity. Instead,
   the distance to nearest breeding pool, wetland, and meadow were related
   to life history stage assortativity, as well as size assortativity in
   males and subadults. Adult males and females displayed affinity for
   breeding pools and meadows and avoidance of other types of wetlands,
   while subadults and nonbreeding adults showed opposite patterns compared
   with breeding adults. Our results indicate that (1) previously
   established guidelines for the minimum size of buffer zones to protect
   wetland-breeding amphibians may be inadequate, (2) nonbreeding wetlands
   may be important core habitat for subadults, and (3) the upland spatial
   organization of amphibians may be used to predict locations of
   undetected breeding pools.},

Title = {Scale-dependence of environmental and socioeconomic drivers of albizia
   invasion in Hawaii},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {70-80},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To reduce the spread and impacts of invasive species in human-dominated
   landscapes, numerous and diverse residents often need to engage in
   individual as well as collective invasive species control efforts on
   their property and in their community. Combating invasion thus requires
   an understanding of what socioeconomic factors, in addition to
   ecological factors, may slow an invasive species or facilitate its
   spread. However, few studies have examined associations between invasive
   species and multi-scale socioeconomic and environmental factors, which
   may influence residents' decisions to control invaders. We combine
   spatially explicit social and environmental datasets, and we apply
   gradient boosting regression to examine the socioeconomic, land use, and
   environmental factors associated with the distribution of albizia
   (Falcataria moluccana), an invasive tree species, in Hawaii. We find
   that environmental factors are the dominant controls on albizia cover at
   the landscape scale, but socioeconomic variables lead to a modest
   improvement in the ability to predict albizia distribution at the
   housing subdivision scale. At the subdivision scale, albizia is more
   common on properties with absentee and/or less-wealthy landowners.
   Albizia is also more common on smaller properties and non-agricultural
   land. Our study provides policy recommendations for reducing the spread
   of invaders and outlines an approach using computation machine learning
   for examining multiple socioeconomic and environmental factors
   associated with biological invasion in complex social landscapes.},

Title = {phenopype: A phenotyping pipeline for Python},

Abstract = {Digital images are an intuitive way to capture, store and analyse
   organismal phenotypes. Many biologists are taking images to collect
   high-dimensional phenotypic information from specimens to investigate
   complex ecological, evolutionary and developmental phenomena, such as
   relationships between trait diversity and ecosystem function,
   multivariate natural selection or developmental plasticity. As a
   consequence, images are being collected at ever-increasing rates, but
   extraction of the contained phenotypic information poses a veritable
   analytical bottleneck. phenopype is a high-throughput phenotyping
   pipeline for the programming language Python that aims at alleviating
   this bottleneck. The package facilitates immediate extraction of
   high-dimensional phenotypic data from digital images with low levels of
   background noise and complexity. At the core, phenopype provides
   functions for rapid signal processing-based image preprocessing and
   segmentation, data extraction, as well as visualization and data export.
   This functionality is provided by wrapping low-level computer vision
   libraries (such as OpenCV) into accessible functions to facilitate
   scientific image analysis. In addition, phenopype provides a project
   management ecosystem to streamline data collection and to increase
   reproducibility. phenopype offers two different workflows that support
   users during different stages of scientific image analysis. The
   low-throughput workflow uses regular Python syntax and has greater
   flexibility at the cost of reproducibility, which is suitable for
   prototyping during the initial stages of a research project. The
   high-throughput workflow allows users to specify and store
   image-specific settings for analysis in human-readable YAML format, and
   then execute all functions in one step by means of an interactive
   parser. This approach facilitates rapid program-user interactions during
   batch processing, and greatly increases scientific reproducibility.
   Overall, phenopype intends to make the features of powerful but
   technically involved low-level CV libraries available to biologists with
   little or no Python coding experience. Therefore, phenopype is aiming to
   augment, rather than replace the utility of existing Python CV
   libraries, allowing biologists to focus on rapid and reproducible data
   collection. Furthermore, image annotations produced by phenopype can be
   used as training data, thus presenting a stepping stone towards the
   application of deep learning architectures.},

Title = {Photovoice for mobilizing insights on human well-being in complex
   social-ecological systems: case studies from Kenya and South Africa},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The value of diverse perspectives in social-ecological systems research
   and transdisciplinarity is well recognized. Human well-being and how it
   is derived from dynamic ecosystems is one area where local knowledge and
   perspectives are critical for designing interventions for sustainable
   pathways out of poverty. However, to realize the potential to enrich the
   understanding of complex dynamics for sustainability, there is a need
   for methods that engage holistic ways of perceiving human-nature
   interactions from multiple worldviews that also acknowledge inequalities
   between scientific and other forms of knowledge. To date, photovoice has
   been used to elicit local knowledge and perspectives about ecosystem
   changes and ecosystem services. We expand this to explore the utility of
   the method for facilitating the mobilization of plural insights on human
   well-being, which is subject to complex social-ecological dynamics, and
   its role in processes for coproduction of knowledge that acknowledges
   the need for equity and usefulness for all actors. Drawing on two cases,
   one in community-based marine protected areas in Kenya and one dealing
   with agricultural decline and rural-urban migration in South Africa, we
   demonstrate two modes of application of photovoice: as a scoping
   exercise and as a deep learning tool. The studies descriptively
   illustrate how photovoice can depict the hidden and often neglected
   intangible connections to ecosystems, plural and disaggregated
   perceptions of complex social-ecological dynamics, and issues of access
   and distribution of ecosystem benefits. The studies also show how
   photovoice can encourage equitable participation of nonacademic actors
   in research processes and in particular contribute to mobilization of
   knowledge and translation of knowledge across knowledge systems. We
   discuss how local perspectives may be further recognized and
   incorporated in transdisciplinary research and reflect on the practical
   and ethical challenges posed by using photographs in participatory
   research on social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Portable locomotion activity monitor (pLAM): A cost-effective setup for
   robust activity tracking in small animals},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {805-812},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Characterising the frequency and timing of biological processes such as
   locomotion, eclosion or foraging, is often needed to get a complete
   picture of a species' ecology. Automated trackers are an invaluable tool
   for high-throughput collection of activity data and have become more
   accurate and efficient with advances in computer vision and deep
   learning. However, tracking activity of small and fast flying animals
   remains a hurdle, especially in a field setting with variable light
   conditions. Commercial activity monitors can be expensive, closed source
   and generally limited to laboratory settings. Here, we present a
   portable locomotion activity monitor (pLAM), a mobile activity detector
   to quantify small animal activity. Our setup uses inexpensive
   components, builds upon open-source motion tracking software, and is
   easy to assemble and use in the field. It runs off-grid, supports
   low-light tracking with infrared lights and can implement arbitrary
   light cycle colours and brightnesses with programmable LEDs. We provide
   a user-friendly guide to assembling pLAM hardware, accessing its
   pre-configured software and guidelines for using it in other systems. We
   benchmarked pLAM for insects under various laboratory and field
   conditions, then compared results to a commercial activity detector.
   They offer broadly similar activity measures, but our setup captures
   flight and bouts of motion that are often missed by beam breaking
   activity detection. pLAM can automate laboratory and field monitoring of
   activity and timing in a wide range of biological processes, including
   circadian rhythm, eclosion and diapause timing, pollination and flower
   foraging, or pest feeding activity. This low cost and easy setup allows
   high-throughput animal behaviour studies for basic and applied ecology
   and evolution research.},

Title = {Bag of tricks for long-tail visual recognition of animal species in
   camera-trap images},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Camera traps are a method for monitoring wildlife and they collect a
   large number of pictures. The number of images collected of each species
   usually follows a long-tail distribution, i.e., a few classes have a
   large number of instances, while a lot of species have just a small
   percentage. Although in most cases these rare species are the ones of
   interest to ecologists, they are often neglected when using
   deep-learning models because these models require a large number of
   images for the training. In this work, a simple and effective framework
   called Square -Root Sampling Branch (SSB) is proposed, which combines
   two classification branches that are trained using square-root sampling
   and instance sampling to improve long-tail visual recognition, and this
   is compared to state-of-the-art methods for handling this task:
   square-root sampling, class-balanced focal loss, and balanced group
   softmax. To achieve a more general conclusion, the methods for handling
   long-tail visual recognition were systematically evaluated in four
   families of computer vision models (ResNet, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2,
   and Swin Transformer) and four camera-trap datasets with different
   characteristics. Initially, a robust baseline with the most recent
   training tricks was prepared and, then, the methods for improving
   long-tail recognition were applied. Our experiments show that
   square-root sampling was the method that most improved the performance
   for minority classes by around 15\%; however, this was at the cost of
   reducing the majority classes' accuracy by at least 3\%. Our proposed
   framework (SSB) demonstrated itself to be competitive with the other
   methods and achieved the best or the second-best results for most of the
   cases for the tail classes; but, unlike the square-root sampling, the
   loss in the performance of the head classes was minimal, thus achieving
   the best trade-off among all the evaluated methods. Our experiments also
   show that Swin Transformer can achieve high performance for rare classes
   without applying any additional method for handling imbalance, and
   attains an overall accuracy of 88.76\% for the WCS dataset and 94.97\%
   for Snapshot Serengeti using a location-based training/test partition.
   Despite the improvement in the tail classes' performance, our
   experiments highlight the need for better methods for handling long-tail
   visual recognition in camera-trap images, since state-of-the-art
   approaches achieve poor performance, especially in classes with just a
   few training instances.},

Abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction occurred alongside a large swath of
   environmental changes that are often invoked as extinction mechanisms,
   even when a direct link is lacking. One way to elucidate the cause(s) of
   a mass extinction is to investigate extinction selectivity, as it can
   reveal critical information on organismic traits as key determinants of
   extinction and survival. Here we show that machine learning algorithms,
   specifically gradient boosted decision trees, can be used to identify
   determinants of extinction as well as to predict extinction risk. To
   understand which factors led to the end-Permian mass extinction during
   an extreme global warming event, we quantified the ecological
   selectivity of marine extinctions in the well-studied South China
   region. We find that extinction selectivity varies between different
   groups of organisms and that a synergy of multiple environmental
   stressors best explains the overall end-Permian extinction selectivity
   pattern. Extinction risk was greater for genera that had a low species
   richness, narrow bathymetric ranges limited to deep-water habitats, a
   stationary mode of life, a siliceous skeleton, or, less critically,
   calcitic skeletons. These selective losses directly link the extinctions
   to the environmental effects of rapid injections of carbon dioxide into
   the ocean-atmosphere system, specifically the combined effects of
   expanded oxygen minimum zones, rapid warming, and potentially ocean
   acidification.},

Abstract = {High-throughput environmental sensing technologies are increasingly
   central to global monitoring of the ecological impacts of human
   activities. In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors
   has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to
   study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses
   to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs
   and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic
   monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats,
   cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept
   studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly
   expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where
   these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and
   biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the
   current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological
   assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities.
   We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing
   rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of
   machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification,
   and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However,
   the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited
   availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio
   processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around
   the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical
   methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we
   emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey
   and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear
   audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework
   for monitoring vocalising animal communities.},

Title = {Field-based adipose tissue quantification in sea turtles using
   bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy validated with CT scans and deep
   learning},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Loss of adipose tissue in vertebrate wildlife species is indicative of
   decreased nutritional and health status and is linked to environmental
   stress and diseases. Body condition indices (BCI) are commonly used in
   ecological studies to estimate adipose tissue mass across wildlife
   populations. However, these indices have poor predictive power, which
   poses the need for quantitative methods for improved population
   assessments. Here, we calibrate bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy
   (BIS) as an alternative approach for assessing the nutritional status of
   vertebrate wildlife in ecological studies. BIS is a portable technology
   that can estimate body composition from measurements of body impedance
   and is widely used in humans. BIS is a predictive technique that
   requires calibration using a reference body composition method. Using
   sea turtles as model organisms, we propose a calibration protocol using
   computed tomography (CT) scans, with the prediction equation being:
   adipose tissue mass (kg) = body mass - (-0.03 {[}intercept] - 0.29 {*}
   length(2)/resistance at 50 kHz + 1.07 {*} body mass - 0.11 {*} time
   after capture). CT imaging allows for the quantification of body fat.
   However, processing the images manually is prohibitive due to the
   extensive time requirement. Using a form of artificial intelligence
   (AI), we trained a computer model to identify and quantify nonadipose
   tissue from the CT images, and adipose tissue was determined by the
   difference in body mass. This process enabled estimating adipose tissue
   mass from bioelectrical impedance measurements. The predictive
   performance of the model was built on 2/3 samples and tested against 1/3
   samples. Prediction of adipose tissue percentage had greater accuracy
   when including impedance parameters (mean bias = 0.11\%-0.61\%) as
   predictor variables, compared with using body mass alone (mean bias =
   6.35\%). Our standardized BIS protocol improves on conventional body
   composition assessment methods (e.g., BCI) by quantifying adipose tissue
   mass. The protocol can be applied to other species for the validation of
   BIS and to provide robust information on the nutritional and health
   status of wildlife, which, in turn, can be used to inform conservation
   decisions at the management level.},

Title = {Weekly carbon dioxide exchange trend predictions in deciduous broadleaf
   forests from site-specific influencing variables},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Weekly net-ecosystem-exchange (NEE) data recorded and verified over
   multiple years, together with site-specific influential ecological
   variables, for distinct deciduous-broadleaf-forest (DBF) sites in North
   America can reveal useful relationships regarding their functions as
   long-term carbon dioxide (CO2) sources and sinks. Machine learning (ML)
   and regression models have greater success at predicting weekly NEE from
   some DBF sites than others, from the available site variables. In
   particular, support vector regression (SVR) and extreme gradient
   boosting (XGG) ML methods perform better than multi-linear regression in
   the weekly NEE predictions they generate using up to 24 influential
   variables. The DBF sites studied are distinguished into those that have
   followed distinctive, albeit fluctuating seasonal NEE trends, and those
   that are characterized by abrupt fluctuations in NEE across the leaf-on
   season. ML models predict weekly NEE for the former sites more reliably
   than for the latter sites. Consideration of the relative influence of
   the variables on the XGB and regression model NEE predictions identifies
   which variables are most influential at specific sites. Short wave
   radiation (in and out) and air temperature are found to be variables
   exerting substantial influence on the prediction models for the sites
   studied. From the prediction results and the relative influences of the
   available environmental variables, it is concluded that complex
   processes are involved at those sites showing rapid NEE fluctuations in
   the leaf-on seasons that are not readily detectable from the
   environmental variables currently being continuously recorded at those
   sites.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal model and machine learning method reveal patterns and
   processes of migration under climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Abstract = {Aim Despite extensive studies of phenological shifts in migration by
   climate change and driving factors of migration, a few issues remain
   unresolved. In particular, little is known about the complex effects of
   driving factors on migration with interactions and nonlinearity, and
   partitioning of the effects of factors into spatial, temporal, and
   spatio-temporal effects. Here, we aim to elucidate migration pattern as
   well as its driving factors under climate change.Location Western North
   Pacific.Taxon North Pacific spiny dogfish Squalus suckleyi.Methods We
   first examined long-term changes in the timing and geographic location
   of migration by applying the Barrier model, a spatio-temporal model, to
   c. 5-decade time series data (1972-2019) for the presence/absence of
   spiny dogfish in the western North Pacific. We then evaluated the
   spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal effects of driving factors (fish
   productivity, sea surface temperature {[}SST], depth and magnetic field)
   on seasonal occurrence patterns using a machine learning model and an
   interpretable machine learning technique.Results The migration area did
   not change over c. 5-decades, whereas the migration timing advanced by a
   month after 2000. The spatial effects of magnetic field and depth were
   consistently large and the spatial and spatio-temporal effects of SST
   increased in the migration season, even though the temporal effect of
   SST was consistently weak.Main Conclusions The migration area of spiny
   dogfish was stable over time because of the effect of magnetic field and
   a strong preference for submarine topography, whereas the migration
   timing advanced as a result of tracking a suitable location based on
   SST, which increased sharply after 2000. Therefore, temperature and
   other factors simultaneously influence migration under climate change,
   highlighting the importance of considering both biotic and abiotic
   factors and understanding the underlying processes in predicting future
   impacts of climate change on species distribution.},

Title = {Application of hyperspectral analysis of chlorophyll a concentration
   inversion in Nansi Lake},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an important water quality safety evaluation
   index, and accurate Chl-a concentration monitoring is important for the
   development of aquaculture, aquatic ecosystem balance, and drinking
   water safety. Rapid and accurate Chl-a concentration determination in
   water using hyperspectral remote sensing is an important subject in
   water ecological environment monitoring. In this study, the spectral
   reflectance and Chl-a concentration of Nansi Lake were measured, and the
   time-frequency method of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis was
   used for the noise reduction and reconstruction of the first-order
   differential of the spectrum to extract sensitive spectral features. The
   eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm was used
   to establish a Chl-a concentration estimation model, and the best
   parameters and model combinations for the inversion of the Chl-a
   concentration in the water column of Nansi Lake were determined. The
   results show that the combined three-band algorithm combination
   parameters obtained from the EMD noise-reduced reconstruction of
   spectral first-order differential (OFODSR-D) data fit the measured Chl-a
   concentrations better than the original spectral (OSR) and OFODSR data,
   with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.8588. Second, the models
   based on OFODSR-D achieved more satisfactory prediction results, with
   XGBoost having the highest estimation accuracy (R-2 of 0.9024 and
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.1312 mu g.L-1 for the inverse model),
   followed by the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model and the
   linear model (R-2 of 0.8474 and 0.8326, and RMSE of 13.3031 and 7.6987
   mu g.L-1, respectively). This study innovatively introduces the EMD
   method to the spectral processing of water bodies, obtains optimal
   parameters for the inversion of the Chl-a concentration, and achieves
   better results. This study provides a new approach to obtaining optimal
   inversion parameters for Chl-a monitoring in inland lake water bodies
   using remote-sensing methods.},

Title = {Dual-fluorescence imaging and automated trophallaxis detection for
   studying multi-nutrient regulation in superorganisms},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1441-1457},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Much like a single organism, colonies of social insects regulate
   their collective nutrition towards a specific intake of nutrients. Yet,
   the mechanisms behind this colony-level regulation are not fully
   understood. Although foraging behaviour in social insects has been
   studied extensively, not much is known on its relation with feeding
   processes that occur within the nest. In the nest, food is commonly
   transferred between individuals in numerous oral feeding interactions
   (trophallaxis). Studies on the properties of these trophallactic
   networks have so far been limited by: (a) the difficulty to
   non-intrusively measure food inside individual ants, let alone its
   nutritional composition, and (b) the meticulous manual labour involved
   in detecting trophallactic events.
   2. Our dual-fluorescence imaging set-up is designed to track two food
   sources, each labelled with a different fluorophore, as they are
   disseminated throughout a freely behaving colony of individually tagged
   ants. Additionally, our image-based deep learning algorithm for
   automatic detection of ant trophallaxis events efficiently yields a
   detailed record of all food-transfer interactions.
   3. Using a series of calibration experiments, we demonstrate the
   reliability of our measurements. We then exemplify the capabilities of
   our new method by tracking food dissemination in a colony of Camponotus
   sanctus ants supplied with two nutritionally distinct food sources. We
   follow the amount of each food type in the crop of each ant in the
   colony. Our data reveal the path in nutrient space that the colony took
   to reach its final nutrient intake, the contributions of the different
   forager ants to this path and the dynamic nutritional states of all ants
   in the colony. We further demonstrate the potential applicability of
   dual-fluorescence food imaging to other insect species.
   4. Our system provides access to data that were previously unavailable
   and is crucial for a complete description of nutrient regulation by
   social insects. More broadly, the ability to simultaneously and
   efficiently track two material flows in a behaving colony provides new
   opportunities for tackling many open and emerging questions on topics
   other than nutrition, such as disease spread and social regulation of
   colony development.},

Title = {Using seasonal landscape models to predict space use and migratory
   patterns of an arctic ungulate},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundCaribou in the Western Arctic Herd undertake one of the
   longest, remaining intact migrations of terrestrial mammals in the
   world. They are also the most important subsistence resource for many
   northern rural residents, who rely on the caribou's migratory movements
   to bring them near for harvest. Migratory geography has never been
   static, but subsistence harvesters have reported recent shifts in
   migration away from areas where they traditionally occurred. The reasons
   behind these changes are not well-understood, but may be related to
   rapid climate change and anthropogenic disturbances.MethodsTo predict
   changes in distribution and shifting migratory areas over the past
   decade, we used GPS telemetry data from adult females to develop
   predictive ecological niche models of caribou across northwestern
   Alaska. We employed the machine-learning algorithm, TreeNet, to analyze
   interactive, multivariate relationships between telemetry locations and
   37 spatial environmental layers and to predict the distributions of
   caribou during spring, calving season, insect-harassment season, late
   summer, fall, and winter from 2009 to 2017. Model results were analyzed
   to identify regions of repeated predicted use, quantify mean longitude,
   predict land cover selection, and track migratory changes over
   time.ResultsDistribution models accurately predicted caribou at a
   spatially-explicit, 500-m scale. Model analyses identified migratory
   areas that shifted annually across the region, but which predicted 4
   main areas of repeated use. Niche models were defined largely by
   non-linear relationships with coastally-influenced, climatic variables,
   especially snow-free date, potential evapo-transpiration, growing season
   length, proximity to sea ice, winter precipitation and fall temperature.
   Proximity to roads and communities were also important and we predicted
   caribou to generally occur more than 20-100km from these
   features.ConclusionsWestern Arctic Herd caribou were predicted to occur
   in warmer, snow-free and treeless areas that may provide conditions
   conducive for efficient travel and foraging. Rapidly changing seasonal
   climates and coastal influences that determine forage availability, and
   human impediments that slow or divert movements are related to
   geographically and phenologically dynamic migration patterns that may
   periodically shift caribou away from traditional harvest areas. An
   enhanced understanding of the geographic behavior of caribou over time
   could inform traditional harvests and help conserve important Western
   Arctic caribou migratory areas.},

Title = {Regional mapping of species-level continuous foliar cover: beyond
   categorical vegetation mapping},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ability to quantify spatial patterns and detect change in
   terrestrial vegetation across large landscapes depends on linking
   ground-based measurements of vegetation to remotely sensed data. Unlike
   non-overlapping categorical vegetation types (i.e., typical vegetation
   and land cover maps), species-level gradients of foliar cover are
   consistent with the ecological theories of individualistic response of
   species and niche space. We collected foliar cover data for vascular
   plant, bryophyte, and lichen species and 17 environmental variables in
   the Arctic Coastal Plain and Brooks Foothills of Alaska from 2012 to
   2017. We integrated these data into a standardized database with 13
   additional vegetation survey and monitoring data sets in northern Alaska
   collected from 1998 to 2017. To map the patterns of foliar cover for six
   dominant and widespread vascular plant species in arctic Alaska, we
   statistically associated ground-based measurements of species
   distribution and abundance to environmental and multi-season spectral
   covariates using a Bayesian statistical learning approach. For five of
   the six modeled species, our models predicted 36\% to 65\% of the
   observed species-level variation in foliar cover. Overall, our
   continuous foliar cover maps predicted more of the observed spatial
   heterogeneity in species distribution and abundance than an existing
   categorical vegetation map. Mapping continuous foliar cover at the
   species level also revealed ecological patterns obscured by aggregation
   in existing plant functional type approaches. Species-level analysis of
   vegetation patterns enables quantifying and monitoring landscape-level
   changes in species, vegetation communities, and wildlife habitat
   independently of subjective categorical vegetation types and facilitates
   integrating spatial patterns across multiple ecological scales. The
   novel species-level foliar cover mapping approach described here
   provides spatial information about the functional role of plant species
   in vegetation communities and wildlife habitat that are not available in
   categorical vegetation maps or quantitative maps of broadly defined
   vegetation aggregates.},

Title = {Determinants of habitat suitability models transferability across

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Transferability of habitat suitability models (HSMs), essential to
   accurately predict outside calibration conditions, has been seldom
   investigated at intraspecific level. We targeted Vipera ursinii ursinii,
   a meadow viper from southeastern France and central Italy, to assess
   determinants of transferability among geographically disjunct
   populations. We fitted HSMs upon occurrences of the Italian and French
   populations separately, as well as on the combined occurrence dataset.
   Internal transferability of HSMs, on spatially independent test data
   drawn from the calibration region, and their external transferability on
   the geographically disjunct populations were evaluated according to (a)
   use of full or spatially rarefied presence datasets; (b) ecology-driven
   or statistics-driven filtering of predictors; (c) modeling algorithm,
   testing generalized additive models and gradient boosting models; and
   (d) multivariate environmental novelty within test data. Niche overlap
   between French and Italian populations was also tested. Niche overlap
   was low, but niche divergence between the two populations' clusters was
   not corroborated. Nonetheless, wider niche breadth and heterogeneity of
   background environmental conditions characterizing the French
   populations led to low intercluster transferability. Although models
   fitted on the combined datasets did not attain consistently higher
   internal transferability than those separately fitted for the French and
   Italian populations, ensemble projection from the HSMs fitted on the
   joint occurrences produced more consistent suitability predictions
   across the full range of V. u. ursinii. Spatial thinning of occurrences
   ameliorated internal transferability but did not affect external
   transferability. The two approaches to predictors filtering did not
   differ in transferability of the respective HSMs but led to discrepant
   estimated environment-occurrence relationships and spatial predictions,
   while the two algorithms attained different relative rankings depending
   on the considered prediction task. Multivariate novelty of projection
   sites was negatively correlated to both internal transferability and
   external transferability. Our findings clarify issues researchers should
   keep in mind when using HSMs to get predictions across geographically
   disjunct populations.},

Title = {Implementation and application of multiple potential natural vegetation
   models - a case study of Hungary},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Questions: Multiple potential natural vegetation (MPNV) is a framework
   for the probabilistic andmultilayer representation of potential
   vegetation in an area. How can an MPNV model be implemented and
   synthesized for the full range of vegetation types across a large
   spatial domain such as a country? What additional ecological and
   practical information can be gained compared to traditional potential
   natural vegetation (PNV) estimates?
   Location: Hungary.
   Methods: MPNV was estimated by modelling the occurrence probabilities of
   individual vegetation types using gradient boosting models (GBM).
   Vegetation data from the Hungarian Actual Habitat Database (META) and
   information on the abiotic background (climatic data, soil
   characteristics, hydrology) were used as inputs to the models. To
   facilitate MPNV interpretation a new technique for model synthesis (re -
   scaling) enabling comprehensive visual presentation (synthetic maps) was
   developed which allows for a comparative view of the potential
   distribution of individual vegetation types.
   Results: The main result of MPNV modelling is a series of raw and re -
   scaled probability maps of individual vegetation types for Hungary. Raw
   probabilities best suit within - type analyses, while re - scaled
   estimations can also be compared across vegetation types. The latter
   create a synthetic overview of a location's PNV as a ranked list of
   vegetation types, and make the comparison of actual and potential
   landscape composition possible. For example, a representation of forest
   vs grasslands in MPNV revealed a high level of overlap of the potential
   range of the two formations in Hungary.
   Conclusion: The MPNV approach allows viewing the potential vegetation
   composition of locations in far more detail than the PNV approach. Re -
   scaling the probabilities estimated by the models allows easy access to
   the results by making potential presence of vegetation types with
   different data structure comparable for queries and synthetic maps. The
   wide range of applications identified for MPNV (conservation and
   restoration prioritization, landscape evaluation) suggests that the PNV
   concept with the extension towards vegetation distributions is useful
   both for research and application.},

Title = {Climate contributes to the evolution of pesticide resistance},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Aim: The evolution of pesticide resistance through space and time is of
   great economic significance to modern agricultural production systems,
   and consequently, is often well documented. It can thus be used to
   dissect the evolutionary and ecological processes that underpin
   large-scale evolutionary responses. There are now nearly 600 documented
   cases of pesticide resistance in arthropod pests. Although the evolution
   of resistance is often attributed to the persistent use of chemicals for
   pest suppression, the rate of development of resistance should also
   depend on other factors, including climatic conditions that influence
   population size and generation time. Here, we test whether climatic
   variables are linked to evolution of resistance by examining the spatial
   pattern of pyrethroid resistance in an important agricultural pest.
   Location: Southern, agricultural regions of Australia.
   Time period: 2007-2015.
   Major taxa studied: The redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor.
   Methods: We quantified patterns of chemical usage based on paddock
   histories and collated long-term climatic data. These data were then
   compared against presence-absence data on resistance using a boosted
   regression-tree approach, applied here for the first time to the spatial
   categorization of pesticide resistance.
   Results: Although chemical usage was a key driver of resistance, our
   analysis revealed climate-based signals in the spatial distribution of
   resistance, linked to regional variation in aridity, temperature
   seasonality and precipitation patterns. Climatic regions supporting
   increased voltinism were positively correlated with resistance, in line
   with expectations that increased voltinism should accelerate
   evolutionary responses to selection pressures.
   Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prediction of rapid
   evolutionary processes at continental scales, such as pesticide
   resistance, will be improved through methods that incorporate climate
   and ecology, in addition to more immediate selection pressures, such as
   chemical usage. Boosted regression trees present a powerful tool in the
   management of resistance issues that has hitherto not been used.},

Title = {A lightweight algorithm capable of accurately identifying forest fires
   from UAV remote sensing imagery},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},

Abstract = {Forest fires often have a devastating effect on the planet's ecology.
   Accurate and rapid monitoring of forest fires has therefore become a
   major focus of current research. Considering that manual monitoring is
   often inefficient, UAV-based remote sensing fire monitoring algorithms
   based on deep learning are widely studied and used. In UAV monitoring,
   the size of the flames is very small and potentially heavily obscured by
   trees, so the algorithm is limited in the amount of valid information it
   can extract. If we were to increase the ability of the algorithm to
   extract valid information simply by increasing the complexity of the
   algorithm, then the algorithm would run much slower, ultimately reducing
   the value of the algorithm to the application. To achieve a breakthrough
   in both algorithm speed and accuracy, this manuscript proposes a
   two-stage recognition method that combines the novel YOLO algorithm
   (FireYOLO) with Real-ESRGAN. Firstly, as regards the structure of the
   FireYOLO algorithm, ``the backbone part adopts GhostNet and introduces a
   dynamic convolutional structure, which im-proves the information
   extraction capability of the morphologically variable flame while
   greatly reducing the computational effort; the neck part introduces a
   novel cross-layer connected, two-branch Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)
   structure, which greatly improves the information extraction capability
   of small targets and reduces the loss in the information transmission
   process; the head embeds the attention-guided module (ESNet) proposed in
   this paper, which enhances the attention capability of small
   targets{''}. Secondly, the flame region recognized by FireYOLO is input
   into Real-ESRGAN after a series of cropping and stitching operations to
   enhance the clarity, and then the enhanced image is recognized for the
   second time with FireYOLO, and, finally, the recognition result is
   overwritten back into the original image. Our experiments show that the
   algorithms in this paper run very well on both PC-based and embedded
   devices, adapting very well to situations where they are obscured by
   trees as well as changes in lighting. The overall recognition speed of
   Jeston Xavier NX is about 20.67 FPS (latency-free real-time inference),
   which is 21.09\% higher than the AP of YOLOv5x, and are one of the best
   performance fire detection algorithm with excellent application
   prospects.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can be used to
   automate the acquisition of ecological knowledge, i.e., automate the
   construction of ecological models. This paper describes a particular
   methodology of machine learning, called rule induction, and its
   application to data analysis in several ecological domains. These
   include the biological classification of British rivers based on
   bioindicator data, the analysis of the influence of physical and
   chemical parameters on selected bioindicator organisms in Slovenian
   rivers and the biological classification of Slovenian rivers based on
   physical and chemical parameters as well as bioindicator data. In all
   three cases, valuable models (knowledge) in the form of rules were
   extracted from data acquired through environmental monitoring and/or
   expert interpretation of the acquired samples. This provides positive
   evidence for the utility of machine learning in ecological modelling.

Abstract = {Predicting coexistence patterns is a current challenge to understand
   diversity maintenance, especially in rich communities where these
   patterns' complexity is magnified through indirect interactions that
   prevent their approximation with classical experimental approaches. We
   explore cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques called Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to predict species coexistence patterns
   in vegetation patches, training generative adversarial networks (GAN)
   and variational AutoEncoders (VAE) that are then used to unravel some of
   the mechanisms behind community assemblage. The GAN accurately
   reproduces real patches' species composition and plant species' affinity
   to different soil types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of
   accuracy, above 99\%. Using the artificially generated patches, we found
   that high-order interactions tend to suppress the positive effects of
   low-order interactions. Finally, by reconstructing successional
   trajectories, we could identify the pioneer species with larger
   potential to generate a high diversity of distinct patches in terms of
   species composition. Understanding the complexity of species coexistence
   patterns in diverse ecological communities requires new approaches
   beyond heuristic rules. Generative Artificial Intelligence can be a
   powerful tool to this end as it allows to overcome the inherent
   dimensionality of this challenge.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in machine learning have expanded data-driven
   modelling (DDM) capabilities, allowing artificial intelligence to infer
   the behaviour of a system by computing and exploiting correlations
   between observed variables within it. Machine learning algorithms may
   enable the use of increasingly available `big data' and assist applying
   ecosystem service models across scales, analysing and predicting the
   flows of these services to disaggregated beneficiaries. We use the Weka
   and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South
   Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African
   example demonstrates that DDM (64-91\% accuracy) can identify the areas
   where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy
   as conventional modelling techniques (54-77\% accuracy). The Sicilian
   example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision
   makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with
   uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the
   DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of
   uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for
   potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role
   to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce
   interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex
   socio-ecological issues. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence in general: and in machine
   learning in particular, enable scientists to apply new machine learning
   technics to their specific areas. In our work we apply such a machine
   learning technique to the modelling of population dynamics of red deer
   for the 40000 hectares co-natural manage forest area on high Karst of
   Notranjska in Slovenia. We used the RETIS program, a machine learning
   tool developed by A. Karalie at the Institute Jozef Stefan in Ljubljana.
   This program induces regression trees from data, and has already been
   applied to several ecological problems. RETIS was applied on data,
   collected in the period 1976-1994, which included several meteorological
   parameters, parameters about the state of the forest, and parameters
   about the population of the red deer. Given these data about the
   observed system, the system RETIS automatically induces a model which
   has the form of a regression tree. We evaluate our induced models
   qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we
   present an expert interpretation of the models. We show that
   quantitatively, using the models (we use a relative prediction error)
   and given the meteorological parameters during winter and summer and an
   estimate of the number of red deer in the area, it is possible to
   predict the state of the forest in the near future. This is very
   important for maintaining the balance between red deer population and
   other parameters of the forest, which will allow sustainable development
   of the complex forest ecosystem. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Ensemble algorithms for ecological niche modeling from
   presence-background and presence-only data},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Ecological niche modeling is central to many problems in population
   dynamics, conservation biology, biogeography, and evolutionary ecology.
   Recently, methodological advances have been achieved by adopting
   modeling principles from statistical and machine learning. One such
   principle that has not been explored is that voted ensembles of weakly
   tuned (underfit) models often exhibit similar bias and lower variance
   than individual well-tuned models. A further contribution of machine
   learning is the one class support vector machine. One class support
   vector machines may be more suited to ecological niche modeling than
   classification algorithms because the ``boundary estimation'' property
   of this class of models better represents the conception of the niche as
   the set of environments in which populations of a species persist. This
   paper brings together these approaches and applies them to a data set on
   the distribution two-spined blackfish (Gadopsis bispinosus) in
   southeastern Australia with the aim of improving performance and
   enriching the repertoire of methods for ecological niche modeling.
   First, a study of low-bias bagging (LOBAG) applied to conventional
   two-class support vector machines, an approach to presence-background
   modeling, found this method to be comparable to another widely used
   method, MAXENT. Next, I introduce a variant of LOBAG for one class
   classification, LOBAG-OC, to be used for ecological niche modeling with
   presence-only data. This method performed better than other
   presence-only methods (DOMAIN and BIOCLIM) and nearly as well as LOBAG
   and MAXENT, despite the fact that the presence-only problem is
   considerably more difficult than the corresponding presence-background
   problem. Results of these analyses suggest that LOBAG and LOBAG-OC may
   provide robust, high-performing solutions to the presence-background and
   presence-only modeling problems and point to ways in which ecological
   niche modeling may be simultaneously both improved and automated.},

Abstract = {Cancer is an understudied but important process in wildlife. Cancerous
   cells are proposed to have had significant effect on the evolution of
   metazoan species due to their negative effect on host fitness. However,
   gaining knowledge on the impact of cancer on species and ecosystems is
   currently relatively slow as it requires expertise in both ecology and
   oncology. The field can greatly benefit from automation to reduce the
   need of excessive manpower and analyse complex ecological datasets. In
   this commentary, we examine how machine learning has been used to gain
   knowledge on oncogenic processes in wildlife. Using a landscape ecology
   approach, we explore spatial scales ranging from the size of a molecule
   up to whole ecosystems and detail, for each level, how machine learning
   has been used, or could contribute to obtain insights on cancer in
   wildlife populations and ecosystems. We illustrate how machine learning
   is a powerful toolbox to conduct studies at the interface of ecology and
   oncology. We provide guidance for the readers of both fields on how to
   implement machine learning tools in their research and identify
   directions to move the field forward using this promising technology. We
   demonstrate how applying machine learning to complex ecological datasets
   will (a) contribute to quantitating the effect of cancer at different
   life stages in wildlife; (b) allow the mining of long-term datasets to
   understand the spatiotemporal variability of cancer risk factors and (c)
   contribute to mitigating cancer risk factors and the conservation of
   endangered species. With this study, we aim to facilitate the use of
   machine learning to wildlife species and to encourage discussion between
   the scientists of the fields of oncology and ecology. We highlight the
   importance of international and pluridisciplinary collaborations to
   collect high-quality datasets on which efficient machine learning
   algorithms can be trained.},

Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {The grand ambition of theorists studying ecology and evolution is to
   discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the world's
   biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity within species to
   differences between populations, communities, and ecosystems. This
   ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the
   complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of
   theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case
   in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great
   deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population
   genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to
   ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical
   scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of
   theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal
   languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in
   ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve
   uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic
   and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge
   bases that combine logic's ability to represent complex mathematical
   ideas with probability theory's ability to model uncertainty. We
   describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to
   build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.},

Abstract = {Humanity is facing many grand challenges at unprecedented rates, nearly
   everywhere, and at all levels. Yet virtually all these challenges can be
   traced back to the decision and behavior of autonomous agents that
   constitute the complex systems under such challenges. Agent-based
   modeling has been developed and employed to address such challenges for
   a few decades with great achievements and caveats. This article reviews
   the advances of ABM in social, ecological, and socio-ecological systems,
   compare ABM with other traditional, equation-based models, provide
   guidelines for ABM novice, modelers, and reviewers, and point out the
   challenges and impending tasks that need to be addressed for the ABM
   community. We further point out great opportunities arising from new
   forms of data, data science and artificial intelligence, showing that
   agent behavioral rules can be derived through data mining and machine
   learning. Towards the end, we call for a new science of Agent-based
   Complex Systems (ACS) that can pave an effective way to tackle the grand
   challenges.},

Title = {Robust ecological analysis of camera trap data labelled by a machine

Abstract = {Ecological data are collected over vast geographic areas using digital
   sensors such as camera traps and bioacoustic recorders. Camera traps
   have become the standard method for surveying many terrestrial mammals
   and birds, but camera trap arrays often generate millions of images that
   are time-consuming to label. This causes significant latency between
   data collection and subsequent inference, which impedes conservation at
   a time of ecological crisis. Machine learning algorithms have been
   developed to improve the speed of labelling camera trap data, but it is
   uncertain how the outputs of these models can be used in ecological
   analyses without secondary validation by a human.
   Here, we present our approach to developing, testing and applying a
   machine learning model to camera trap data for the purpose of achieving
   fully automated ecological analyses. As a case-study, we built a model
   to classify 26 Central African forest mammal and bird species (or
   groups). The model generalizes to new spatially and temporally
   independent data (n = 227 camera stations, n = 23,868 images), and
   outperforms humans in several respects (e.g. detecting `invisible'
   animals). We demonstrate how ecologists can evaluate a machine learning
   model's precision and accuracy in an ecological context by comparing
   species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and occupancy
   (n = 4 species tested) derived from machine learning labels with the
   same estimates derived from expert labels.
   Results show that fully automated species labels can be equivalent to
   expert labels when calculating species richness, activity patterns (n =
   4 species tested) and estimating occupancy (n = 3 of 4 species tested)
   in a large, completely out-of-sample test dataset. Simple thresholding
   using the Softmax values (i.e. excluding `uncertain' labels) improved
   the model's performance when calculating activity patterns and
   estimating occupancy but did not improve estimates of species richness.
   We conclude that, with adequate testing and evaluation in an ecological
   context, a machine learning model can generate labels for direct use in
   ecological analyses without the need for manual validation. We provide
   the user-community with a multi-platform, multi-language graphical user
   interface that can be used to run our model offline.},

Abstract = {Context Use of statistical models developed with machine-learning
   algorithms is increasing in the ecological sciences, yet these
   disciplines have not capitalized on the ability to use cost matrices to
   selectively reduce classification errors that have highly detrimental
   consequences. Objectives Our aim was to promote such applications by
   demonstrating the process of using a cost matrix to decrease specific
   types of misclassification, explaining the importance of exploring the
   effectiveness of cost matrices for a given dataset, and encouraging use
   of cost matrices with machine-learning models in landscape-ecological
   and conservation contexts. Methods Bird occurrence data, landscape and
   regional land-cover data, costs of false-positive and false-negative
   errors, and the C5.0 decision tree algorithm were used to train and test
   a binary classifier. Results Increasing the cost for false negatives
   tended to decrease the frequency of this error type while allowing for
   reasonable predictive performance for each class separately and both
   classes combined. Conclusions Cost matrices are applicable to many
   different categorical response variables and spatial scales. We
   encourage landscape ecologists and planners to explore the effectiveness
   of cost matrices for their particular dataset and project goals,
   especially when conservation of biodiversity across broad spatial
   extents is at stake.},

Abstract = {Drones and machine learning-based automated detection methods are being
   used by ecologists to conduct wildlife surveys with increasing
   frequency. When traditional survey methods have been evaluated, a range
   of factors have been found to influence detection probabilities,
   including individual differences among conspecific animals, which can
   thus introduce biases into survey counts. There has been no such
   evaluation of drone-based surveys using automated detection in a natural
   setting. This is important to establish since any biases in counts made
   using these methods will need to be accounted for, to provide accurate
   data and improve decision-making for threatened species. In this study,
   a rare opportunity to survey a ground-truthed, individually marked
   population of 48 koalas in their natural habitat allowed for direct
   comparison of the factors impacting detection probability in both ground
   observation and drone surveys with manual and automated detection. We
   found that sex and host tree preferences impacted detection in ground
   surveys and in manual analysis of drone imagery with female koalas
   likely to be under-represented, and koalas higher in taller trees
   detected less frequently when present. Tree species composition of a
   forest stand also impacted on detections. In contrast, none of these
   factors impacted on automated detection. This suggests that the
   combination of drone-captured imagery and machine learning does not
   suffer from the same biases that affect conventional ground surveys.
   This provides further evidence that drones and machine learning are
   promising tools for gathering reliable detection data to better inform
   the management of threatened populations.},

Title = {Modelling ecological niches with support vector machines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {424-432},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. The ecological niche is a fundamental biological concept. Modelling
   species' niches is central to numerous ecological applications,
   including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for
   disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of
   anthropogenic and natural climate change on species' ranges.
   2. A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept
   (the multidimensional hyperspace of species' environmental requirements)
   is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species
   persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the
   support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support
   vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only
   observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106
   species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to
   nine environmental covariates.
   3. We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their
   approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with
   independent observations of both species presence and species absence.
   We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables
   and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall.
   Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are
   theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence
   data and are comparable in empirical tests.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are
   crucial for effective environmental planning, management and
   conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human
   health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than
   classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade
   species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models
   based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a
   statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying
   species' potential distributions and to project changes in these
   distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape
   alteration.},

Title = {Estimating Abiotic Thresholds for Sagebrush Condition Class in the

Journal = {RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2},
Pages = {297-308},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sagebrush ecosystems of the western United States can transition from
   extended periods of relatively stable conditions to rapid ecological
   change if acute disturbances occur. Areas dominated by native sagebrush
   can transition from species-rich native systems to altered states where
   non-native annual grasses dominate, if resistance to annual grasses is
   low. The non-native annual grasses provide relatively little value to
   wildlife, livestock, and humans and function as fuel that increases fire
   frequency. The more land area covered by annual grasses, the higher the
   potential for fire, thus reducing the potential for native vegetation to
   reestablish, even when applying restoration treatments. Mapping areas of
   stability and areas of change using machine-learning algorithms allows
   both the identification of dominant abiotic variables that drive
   ecosystem dynamics and the variables' important thresholds. We develop a
   decision-tree model with rulesets that estimate three classes of
   sagebrush condition (i.e., sagebrush recovery, tipping point
   {[}ecosystem degradation], and stable). We find rulesets that primarily
   drive development of the sagebrush recovery class indicate areas of
   midelevations (1 602 m), warm 30-yr July temperature maximums (tmax)
   (30.62 degrees C), and 30-yr March precipitation (ppt) averages equal to
   26.26 mm, about 10\% of the 30-yr annual ppt values. Tipping point and
   stable classes occur at elevations that are lower (1 505 m) and higher
   (1 939 m), respectively, more mesic during March and annually, and
   experience lower 30-yr July tmax averages. These defined variable
   averages can be used to understand current dynamics of sagebrush
   condition and to predict where future transitions may occur under novel
   conditions. (C) 2019 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Title = {A machine-learning approach to predict success of a biocontrol for
   invasive Eurasian watermilfoil reduction},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Myriophyllum spicatum, more commonly known as Eurasian watermilfoil
   (EWM), is one of the most invasive aquatic plants in North America,
   causing negative ecological and economic impacts in ecosystems where it
   proliferates. Many control strategies have been developed and
   implemented to mitigate EWM growth and spread, although the results are
   mixed and there is no consensus on lake-specific strategies. Here, we
   describe the development of a predictive model using a support vector
   technique, that predicts the success of biological pest control using
   Euhrychiopsis lecontei (the milfoil weevil), a milfoil specialist, to
   reduce EWM in lakes. Such a model is informed by lake characteristics
   (limnological and landscape) and augmentation strategies. To develop our
   predictive model, we performed a metadata analysis from 133 published
   peer-reviewed literature and professional reports of milfoil weevil
   augmentation field experiments that contained information on lake
   characteristics. The predictive model's algorithm uses a support vector
   machine (SMV) to learn patterns among lake characteristics, along with
   the recorded augmentation strategy and the reported success of each
   study, where success is a measure of EWM change over a season and is
   recorded in a variety of ways (e.g., EWM biomass change, EWM percent
   change, EWM visual change, etc.,). Overall, the model results suggests
   that shallower lakes, more frequent weevil augmentations, and larger
   weevil overwintering habitat are the most important predictors for EWM
   reduction success by weevil augmentation. Although watermilfoil weevil
   augmentation is a promising mitigation strategy, it may not work for all
   lakes. However, in terms of suggesting weevil augmentation, our model is
   a valuable tool for lake stakeholders and resource managers, who can use
   it to determine whether milfoil weevil augmentation, which can be very
   costly due to the difficulties in finding and raising milfoil weevils,
   will be a useful and sustainable approach to control EWM in their lake
   community.},

Abstract = {People are increasing the requirements for medical ecology in past years
   so that the establishment of an electronic medical care mechanism

   the research objects for this study. Based on the annual statistical
   reports of the hospitals, ``Delphi Method{''} and `` Data Envelopment

   are summarized as followings. 1. One DMU presents strong efficiency on
   the artificial intelligence medical assistant system performance, 4 DMUs
   show the efficiency in 0.9-1, and 5 DMUs appear the efficiency lower
   than 0.9. 2. Sensitivity analysis is utilized for analyzing and finding
   out the critical factors in the application of artificial intelligence
   medical assistant systems to medical ecology, and the inputs and outputs
   are gradually removed for DEA to understand the sensitivity to
   efficiency. According to the results, suggestions are proposed,

Abstract = {Species are considered to be the basic unit of ecological and
   evolutionary studies. As multilocus genomic data are increasingly
   available, there have been considerable interests in the use of DNA
   sequence data to delimit species. In this study, we show that machine
   learning can be used for species delimitation. Our method treats the
   species delimitation problem as a classification problem for identifying
   the category of a new observation on the basis of training data.
   Extensive simulation is first conducted over a broad range of
   evolutionary parameters for training purposes. Each pair of known
   populations is combined to form training samples with a label of same
   species or different species. We use support vector machine (SVM) to
   train a classifier using a set of summary statistics computed from
   training samples as features. The trained classifier can classify a test
   sample to two outcomes: same species or different species. Given
   multilocus genomic data of multiple related organisms or populations,
   our method (called CLADES) performs species delimitation by first
   classifying pairs of populations. CLADES then delimits species by
   maximizing the likelihood of species assignment for multiple
   populations. CLADES is evaluated through extensive simulation and also
   tested on real genetic data. We show that CLADES is both accurate and
   efficient for species delimitation when compared with existing methods.
   CLADES can be useful especially when existing methods have difficulty in
   delimitation, for example with short species divergence time and gene
   flow.},

Abstract = {Under the advance of time, development of science and technology, and
   popularity of network, the combination of medical ecological environment
   and information \& communication technology provides diverse medical
   care services for the public. Having the elderly receive diverse medical
   services in neighboring communities, under constantly increasing medical
   expenses becomes the common objective of various countries. An
   artificial intelligence medical service system might be the ideal tool
   to actualize local aging. Taking prefecture-level cities in Shanghai as
   samples, total 16 DMUs are studied. With the operation of Modified
   Delphi Method, the geometric mean is used as the consensus of experts'
   input/ output evaluation; and, DEA is applied to evaluate the
   performance on the introduction of artificial intelligence medical
   service system into medical ecological environment. The research results
   conclude that one DMU presents strong efficiency on the introduction of
   artificial intelligence medical service system into medical ecological
   environment, 6 DMUs reveal the efficiency in 0.9-1, and 9 DMUs appear
   the efficiency lower than 0.9. Slack Variable Analysis is further
   applied to improve excess and short inputs of prefecture-level cities.
   According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting that
   medical staff could real-time grasp the physiological state and offer
   timely assistance to reduce medical costs, promote the quality of life
   of people in communities, and improve doctor-patient interactive
   relationship.},

Title = {Support vector machines for predicting distribution of sudden oak death
   in California},

Year = {2005},

Abstract = {In the central California coastal forests, a newly discovered virulent
   pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum) has killed hundreds of thousands of
   native oak trees. Predicting the potential distribution of the disease
   in California remains an urgent demand of regulators and scientists.
   Most methods used to map potential ranges of species (e.g. multivariate
   or logistic regression) require both presence and absence data, the
   latter of which are not always feasibly collected, and thus the methods
   often require the generation of `pseudo' absence data. Other methods
   (e.g. BIOCLIM and DOMAIN) seek to model the presence-only data directly.
   In this study, we present alternative methods to conventional approaches
   to modeling by developing support vector machines (SVMs), which are the
   new generation of machine learning algorithms used to find optimal
   separability between classes within datasets, to predict the potential
   distribution of Sudden Oak Death in California. We compared the
   performances of two types of SVMs models: two-class SVMs with `pseudo'
   absence data and one-class SVMs. Both models performed well. The
   one-class SVMs have a slightly better true-positive rate (0.9272 +/-
   0.0460 S.D.) than the two-class SVMs (0.9105 +/- 0.0712 S.D.). However,
   the area predicted to be at risk for the disease using the one-class
   SVMs (18,441 km(2)) is much larger than that of the two-class SVMs
   (13,828 km(2)). Both models show that the majority of disease risk will
   occur in coastal areas. Compared with the results of two-class SVMs, the
   one-class SVMs predict a potential risk in the foothills of the Sierra
   Nevada mountain ranges; much greater risks are also found in Los Angles
   and Humboldt Counties. We believe the support vector machines when
   coupled with geographic information system (GIS) will be a useful method
   to deal with presence-only data in ecological analysis over a range of
   scales. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to fulfil the millennium development goals and to ensure

   as river water quality monitoring and assessment tools, Ethiopia needs
   data from reference as well as disturbed conditions of surface water
   ecosystems Macroinvertebrates, structural and physical-chemical data
   were in this context collected in the Gilgel Gibe river basin in
   South-Western Ethiopia during the period 2005-2008 In the next stage,
   ecological metrics were compared for their assessment relevance In the
   present paper, classification trees and support vector machines were
   used to induce models describing the relation between the river

Abstract = {The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has resulted in a new
   era of remote sensing, especially for applications requiring accurate
   image classification. This paper describes an automatic method for
   identifying soil and water conservation (SWC) measures from the
   centimeter-resolution imagery of UAVs using an object-based image
   analysis (OBIA) approach and machine learning models, and a support
   vector machine (SVM) model. The study area is located inYitong County
   offilin Province, in the black soil region of northeast China. There are
   four frequently used SWC measures, including ecologically restored
   forests, ecologically restored grasslands, contour ridges, and ridge
   belts. A block of red, green, and blue (RGB) images was obtained on May
   26, 2018, from the study area, and the images were processed to generate
   a high-resolution detailed orthomosaic image (5 cm). Several features
   were derived from the UAV image, including color indices, terrain,
   texture, shape, and edge information, which were incorporated in the
   OBIA method. Three color indices were selected to derive vegetation
   information from the study area, including excess green, normalized
   green-red difference index, and excess green minus excess red.Then a
   number of samples were selected to improve the classification results
   using the SVM model. The results showed that the overall accuracy and
   kappa coefficient were 91.20\% and 0.87, respectively. Thus the OBIA
   method was effective in identifying, classifying, and describing
   detailed SWC measures. However, some objects, such as the stages and
   furrows in the contour ridge measures, were not identified in sonic
   regions using the OBIA method, but the machine-learning model SVM
   resolved this problem.This study shows the substantial benefits of
   centimeter-scale UAV imagery over satellite and airborne remote sensing
   and demonstrates the potential of low-cost RGB cameras for the accurate
   identification of different SWC measures and the detailed derivation of
   the shape parameters of linear SWC measures.},

Abstract = {Improving our ability to predict recruitment is a key element in
   fisheries management. However, the interactions between population
   dynamics and different environmental factors are complex and often
   non-linear, making it difficult to produce robust predictions.
   `Machine-learning' techniques (in particular, supervised classification
   methods) have been proposed as useful tools, to overcome such
   difficulties. In this study, a methodology is proposed to build a robust
   classifier for fish recruitment prediction with sparse and noisy data.
   The methodology consists of 4 steps: (1) a semi-automated recruitment
   discretization method; (2) supervised discretization of predictors; (3)
   multivariate and non-redundant predictors selection: (4) learning a
   probabilistic classifier. in terms of fisheries management, the
   classifier estimated performance has important consequences and, to be
   useful, the manager needs to know the risk that is being taken when
   using this number. Probabilistic classifiers such as `naive Bayes', have
   the advantage that, in addition to the predictions, estimate also the
   probability of each possible outcome. Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus)
   and hake (Merluccius merluccius) recruitments are used as application
   examples. `Two-intervals' recruitment discretization accomplishes 70\%
   accuracies and Brier scores of around 0.10, for both anchovy and hake
   recruitment. In comparison, `three-intervals' recruitment discretization
   accomplishes 50\% accuracies; and Brier scores of around 0.25 for
   anchovy and 0.30 for hake recruitment. These statistics are the result
   of validating not only the classifier, but also the previous steps, as a
   whole methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A review of machine learning and big data applications in addressing
   ecosystem service research gaps},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services are essential for human well-being, but are currently
   facing many natural and anthropogenic threats. Modeling and mapping
   ecosystem services helps us mitigate, adapt to, and manage these
   pressures, but overall the field faces multiple major limitations. These
   include: 1) data availability, 2) understanding, esti-mation, and
   reporting of uncertainties, and 3) connecting socio-ecological aspects
   of ecosystem services. Recent technological advancements in machine
   learning coupled with rising availability of big data, offer an
   opportunity to overcome these challenges. We review studies utilizing
   machine learning and/or big data to overcome these limitations. We
   collect 56 papers that exemplify the current use of machine learning and
   big data to address the three identified gaps in the ecosystem service
   field. We find that although the use of these tools in ecosystem service
   research is relatively new, it is growing quickly. Big data can directly
   address data gaps, especially as new big data resources relevant to
   ecosystem service mapping become available (ex. social media data). Some
   properties of machine learning can also contribute to addressing data
   gaps in data sparse environments. Also, many machine learning algorithms
   can estimate and consider uncertainty, whereas big data can
   significantly increase sample size, reducing uncertainties in some
   situations. Some big data sources, like crowdsourced data, provide
   direct sources of social behaviors and preferences that relate to
   ecosystem service demand, thus allowing researchers to connect social
   and biophysical aspects of ecosystem services. Machine learning
   algorithms provide an effective and efficient tool for handling these
   large nonlinear socio-ecological datasets in tandem, giving researchers
   the ability to more realistically model and map ecosystem services
   without relying on oversimplified proxies or linear algorithms. Despite
   these opportunities, implementation is still lacking and limitations
   still hinder use.},

Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2014},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Most efforts to harness the power of big data for ecology and
   environmental sciences focus on data and metadata sharing,
   standardization, and accuracy. However, many scientists have not
   accepted the data deluge as an integral part of their research because
   the current scientific method is not scalable to large, complex
   datasets. Here, we explain how integrating a data-intensive, machine
   learning approach with a hypothesis-driven, mechanistic approach can
   lead to a novel knowledge, learning, analysis system (KLAS) for
   discovery and problem solving. Machine learning leads to more efficient,
   user-friendly analytics as the streams of data increase while
   hypothesis-driven decisions lead to the strategic design of experiments
   to fill knowledge gaps and to elucidate mechanisms. KLAS will transform
   ecology and environmental sciences by shortening the time lag between
   individual discoveries and leaps in knowledge by the scientific
   community, and will lead to paradigm shifts predicated on open access
   data and analytics in a machine learning environment.},

Title = {Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater: reappreciating the dynamic

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Context The observation of the earth by humans has advanced our
   understanding of the physical patterns and processes that shape the
   landscape. Over time, the act of scientific interpretation has
   transformed into one mediated through machines, creating distance
   between the observer and the observed. Machine learning is expanding
   this gap and transforming how we gain knowledge about the world. Raising
   the question is there something to be lost by advancing machine learning
   at the expense of human visual interpretation? Objectives Recognizing
   the usefulness of these computational algorithms for dealing with
   massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic ecological datasets, scientists
   should not abandon the important contributions of human intelligence to
   understanding landscape patterns, processes, and relationships. Methods
   This paper presents a review of social, cultural, and political or
   military influences on the relationship between humans and remote
   sensing images of the landscape. This review highlights tensions between
   automated machine learning approaches and human interpretation. Results
   Support for the use of human-machine integrated systems through the use
   of interactive, visual display, and the development of transparent
   machine learning methods is suggested. Conclusions The human analyst
   should remain central in the design of landscape ecology applications
   when deploying machine learning algorithms. The complementary strengths
   of the human and machine in data processing suggest that the most
   informative insights regarding pattern and process can happen in the
   implementation of carefully designed Human in the Loop systems.},

Title = {hyperoverlap: Detecting biological overlap in n-dimensional space},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {513-523},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Comparative biological studies often investigate the morphological,
   physiological or ecological divergence (or overlap) between entities
   such as species or populations. Here we discuss the weaknesses of using
   existing methods to analyse patterns of phenotypic overlap and present a
   novel method to analyse co-occurrence in multidimensional space.
   We propose a `hyperoverlap' framework to detect qualitative overlap (or
   divergence) between point datasets and present the hyperoverlap r
   package which implements this framework, including functions for
   visualization. hyperoverlap uses support vector machines (SVMs) to train
   a classifier based on point data (such as morphological or ecological
   data) for two entities. This classifier finds the optimal boundary
   between the two sets of data and compares the predictions to the
   original labels. Misclassification is an evidence of overlap between the
   two entities. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of
   this method compared to existing approaches (e.g. single-entity
   hypervolume models) using the bioclimatic data extracted from global
   occurrence records of conifers.
   We find that there are instances where single-entity hypervolume models
   predict overlap, but there are no observations of either entity in the
   shared hypervolume. In these instances, hyperoverlap reports nonoverlap.
   We show that our method is stable and less likely to be affected by
   sampling biases than current approaches. We also find that hyperoverlap
   is particularly effective for situations involving entities with a small
   number of data points (e.g. narrowly endemic species) for which
   single-entity models cannot be reliably constructed.
   We argue that overlap can be reliably detected using hyperoverlap,
   particularly for descriptive studies. The method proposed here is a
   valuable tool for studying patterns of overlap in a multidimensional
   space.},

Title = {Feature embeddings from the BirdNET algorithm provide insights into
   avian ecology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Bioacoustics has become widely used in the study of acoustically active
   animals, and machine learning algorithms have emerged as efficient and
   effective strategies to identify species vocalizations. Current
   applications of machine learning in bioacoustics often identify acoustic
   events to the species-level but fail to capture the complex acoustic
   repertoires animals use to communicate, which can inform habitat
   associations, demography, behavior, and the life history of cryptic
   species. The penultimate layer of most machine learning algorithms
   results in a vector of numbers describing the input, called feature
   embeddings. Here, we demonstrate that the feature embeddings generated
   by the BirdNET algorithm can enable within-species classifications of
   acoustic events. First, we successfully differentiated adult and
   juvenile Great Gray Owls; second, we identified three unique sounds
   associated with Great Spotted Woodpeckers (series call, alarm call, and
   drumming). These applications of BirdNET feature embeddings suggest that
   researchers can classify vocalizations into groups when group membership
   is unknown, and that within-species grouping is possible even when
   target signals are extremely rare. These applications of a relatively
   ``black-box{''} aspect of machine learning algorithms can be used to
   derive ecologically informative acoustic classifications, which can
   inform the conservation of cryptic and otherwise difficult to study
   species.},

Abstract = {The use of individually-based, detail-rich, simulation models for the
   study of the behavioral ecology of wildlife is expanding for their
   ability to link evolutionary processes operating at the individual level
   (e.g. optimal foraging) to ecological and demographic processes usually
   described at the population level, Within this modelling framework, we
   tested the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) methods and
   object-oriented programming (OOP) to implement behavioral processes in a
   physiologically-based model of the hare (Lepus spp.). This approach is
   interesting and partly innovative because the behavioral rules which
   `move' the animals are based on the simulation of the decision-making
   system itself. Moreover in this model both the landscape and the
   behavior of a predator species (the fox) are taken into account. The
   model is quite complex and its dynamics exhibits interesting emergent
   proprieties which have not been specifically wired in. It has been
   internally validated and a careful calibration of the different
   subsystems has been attempted with respect to the actual behavior of
   hares, The simulated hare exhibits a quite stable ethogram under
   variable environmental conditions and performs both state-conditioned
   activities and an adaptive behavioral strategy, where the animal's
   behavior is modified as a function of the environmental conditions in
   order to maintain a constant (and positive) fitness level. (C) 1997

Title = {Accounting for unknown behaviors of free-living animals in
   accelerometer-based classification models: Demonstration on a
   wide-ranging mesopredator},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Describing the behaviors of free-living animals is broadly useful for
   ecological and physiological research, but obtaining accurate records
   for difficult-to-observe species presents a considerable challenge.
   Tri-axial accelerometers are increasingly used for this purpose by
   exploiting behavioral observations from accelerometercarrying animals to
   predict behaviors of unobserved conspecifics. We developed a modeling
   approach to predict behaviors of wolverines from collar-mounted
   accelerometers using Support Vector Machines. By applying a temporal
   smoothing function and setting a lower threshold for a-posteriori
   prediction probabilities, we improve the predictive performance of our
   model and simultaneously create a framework for explicitly accounting
   for behaviors unknown to the model, a problem that remains largely
   unaddressed in similar studies. We demonstrate that such an approach can
   achieve a model-averaged accuracy of 98.3\%, with high predictive
   performance for the behaviors resting, running, scanning, tearing at
   food, and transferring items with the mouth, a behavior typically
   associated with caching food among captive wolverines. To illustrate the
   utility of this approach, we apply this model to a sample of seven
   free-living wolverines in Arctic Alaska.},

Abstract = {The migratory movements of seabirds (especially smaller species) remain
   poorly understood, despite their role as harvesters of marine ecosystems
   on a global scale and their potential as indicators of ocean health.
   Here we report a successful attempt, using miniature archival light
   loggers (geolocators), to elucidate the migratory behaviour of the Manx
   shearwater Puffinus puffinus, a small (400 g) Northern Hemisphere
   breeding procellariform that undertakes a trans-equatorial,
   trans-Atlantic migration. We provide details of over-wintering areas, of
   previously unobserved marine stopover behaviour, and the long-distance
   movements of females during their pre-laying exodus. Using salt-water
   immersion data from a subset of loggers, we introduce a method of
   behaviour classification based on Bayesian machine learning techniques.
   We used both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to classify
   each bird's daily activity based on simple properties of the immersion
   data. We show that robust activity states emerge, characteristic of
   summer feeding, winter feeding and active migration. These can be used
   to classify probable behaviour throughout the annual cycle, highlighting
   the likely functional significance of stopovers as refuelling stages.},

Title = {Mapping urban form and function at city block level using spatial
   metrics},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {399-409},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the potential of urban metrics describing the
   presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for
   mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level.
   Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology,
   alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial
   arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial
   transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along
   the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal
   composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for
   identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the
   Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define
   built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the
   built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied
   in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the
   distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land
   use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study
   points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics
   for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative
   approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing
   the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric.},

Title = {A Web-based semantic tagging and activity recognition system for
   species' accelerometry data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {47-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Increasingly, animal biologists are taking advantage of low cost
   micro-sensor technology, by deploying accelerometers to monitor the
   behavior and movement of a broad range of species. The result is an
   avalanche of complex tri-axial accelerometer data streams that capture
   observations and measurements of a wide range of animal body motion and
   posture parameters. Analysis of these parameters enables the
   identification of specific animal behaviors however the analysis process
   is immature with much of the activity identification steps undertaken
   manually and subjectively. Consequently, there is an urgent, need for
   the development of new tools to streamline the management, analysis,
   indexing, querying and visualization of such data. In this paper, we
   present a Semantic Annotation and Activity Recognition (SAAR) system
   which supports storing, visualizing, annotating and automatic
   recognition of tri-axial accelerometer data streams by integrating
   semantic annotation and visualization services with Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) techniques. The interactive Web interface enables
   biologists to visualize and correlate 3D accelerometer data streams with
   associated video streams. It also enables domain experts to accurately
   annotate or tag segments of tri-axial accelerometer data streams, with
   standardized terms from an activity ontology. These annotated data
   streams can then be used to dynamically train a hierarchical SVM
   activity classification model, which can be applied to new accelerometer
   data streams to automatically recognize specific activities. This paper
   describes the design, implementation and functional details of the SAAR
   system and the results of the evaluation experiments that assess the
   performance, usability and efficiency of the system. The evaluation
   results indicate that the SAAR system enables ecologists with little
   knowledge of machine learning techniques to collaboratively build
   classification models with high levels of accuracy, sensitivity,
   precision and specificity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Big data-model integration and AI for vector-borne disease prediction},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Predicting the drivers of incursion and expansion of vector-borne
   diseases as part of early-warning strategies (EWS) is a major challenge
   for geographically extensive diseases where spread is mediated by
   spatial heterogeneity in climate and other environmental drivers.
   Geospatial data on these environmental drivers are increasingly
   available affording opportunities for application to a predictive
   disease ecology paradigm provided the data can be synthesized and
   harmonized with fine-scale, highly resolved data on vector and host
   responses to their environment. Here, we apply a multi-scale big
   data-model integration approach using human-guided machine learning to
   objectively evaluate the importance of a large suite of spatially
   distributed environmental variables (>400) to develop EWS for vesicular
   stomatitis (VS), a common viral vector-borne vesicular disease affecting
   livestock throughout the Americas. Two temporally and phylogenetically
   distinct events were used to develop disease occurrence-environment
   relationships in incursion (2004) and expansion years (2005), and then
   to test those relationships (2014, 2015) at two scales: (1) local and
   (2) landscape to regional. Our results show that VS occurrence at a
   local scale of individual landowners was related to conditions that can
   be monitored (rainfall, temperatures, streamflow) or modified
   (vegetation). On-site green vegetation during the month of occurrence
   and higher rainfall four months prior combined with either cool daytime
   (expansion) or nighttime (incursion) temperatures one month prior were
   indicators of VS occurrence. Distance to running water (incursion) and
   host density based on neighboring ranches (expansion) with infected
   animals were also important in individual years. At
   landscape-to-regional scales, conditions that favor specific VSV
   biological vectors were indicated, either black flies in incursion years
   or biting midges in expansion years. Changes in viral genetic lineage
   were less important to patterns in VS occurrence than factors affecting
   the host-vector-environment interactions. In combination with our onset
   map based on latitude, elevation, and long-term annual precipitation,
   this year- and scale-specific information can be used to develop
   strategies to minimize effects of future VS events. This big data
   approach coupled with expert knowledge and machine learning can be
   applied to other emerging diseases for improvement in understanding,
   prediction, and management of vector-borne diseases.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been
   applied to help solve applied ecology problems. Partially observable
   Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are one such example. POMDPs have
   been applied in conservation, applied ecology and natural resource
   management to solve problems such as deciding when to stop managing or
   surveying threatened species that are difficult to detect. POMDP solvers
   are useful to find optimal sequential decisions under imperfect
   detection. However, POMDPs remain inaccessible to most applied
   ecologists. Here, we present the shinyrpackagesmsPOMDPthat solves the
   problem of `When to stop managing or surveying cryptic threatened
   species?' (Chades et al., 2008). We developed this package to address a
   common and challenging problem faced by conservation managers. It has
   broad applications for decision-makers and ecologists by supporting them
   to focus efforts and resources where they are most likely to provide
   benefits to threatened species. OurrpackagesmsPOMDPincludes a set of
   functions that call a POMDP solver, allowing users to solve any stop,
   manage or survey problems that share the same structure as the original
   problem. Our Shinyrapp also allows users to run simulations of optimal
   management and graphically represent the optimal solution.
   ThesmsPOMDPpackage and documentation are hosted at . In artificial
   intelligence, POMDPs are acknowledged as the Swiss army knife of
   decision models. However, POMDP's application in applied ecology remains
   seldom despite repeated evidence of their flexibility. Our
   packagesmsPOMDPis fast and provides an entry point to further develop
   POMDP apps, contributing to further uptake of AI research to solve
   ecological problems.},

Title = {A continuous-score occupancy model that incorporates uncertain machine
   learning output from autonomous biodiversity surveys},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1778-1789},

Abstract = {Ecologists often study biodiversity by evaluating species occupancy and
   the relationship between occupancy and other covariates. Occupancy
   models are now widely used to account for false absences in field
   surveys and to reduce bias in estimates of covariate relationships.
   Existing occupancy models take as inputs binary detection/non-detection
   observations of species at each visit to each site. However, autonomous
   sensing devices and machine learning models are increasingly used to
   survey biodiversity, generating a new type of observation record (i.e.
   continuous-score data) that reflects the model's confidence a species is
   present in each autonomously sensed file, instead of binary
   detection/non-detection data. These data are not directly compatible
   with traditional binary occupancy modelling methods. Here, we develop a
   new occupancy model that models continuous scores on a visit level as a
   Gaussian mixture, combining a distribution of scores for files that do
   contain the species of interest and a distribution of scores for files
   that do not. The model takes as input continuous scores for each
   autonomously sensed and classified file, along with an optional small
   number of binary, manually verified detection and non-detection
   annotations. We present a simulation study that shows that over a range
   of empirically realistic parameters, our model outperforms traditional
   occupancy models that are based on binary annotation alone. We also
   apply this new model to an empirical case study using data generated
   from five machine learning classifiers applied to autonomous acoustic
   recordings gathered in the eastern United States. Because our occupancy
   model generalizes allowable input data beyond binary observations, it is
   particularly well-suited to the increasing volume of machine learning
   classified data in ecology and conservation.},

Abstract = {BEFANA is a free and open-source software tool for ecological network
   analysis and visualisation. It is adapted to ecologists??? needs and
   allows them to study the topology and dynamics of ecological networks as

   implemented in Python, and structured as an ordered collection of
   interactive computational notebooks. It relies on widely used
   open-source libraries, and aims to achieve simplicity, interactivity,
   and extensibility. BEFANA provides methods and implementations for data
   loading and pre-processing, network analysis and interactive
   visualisation, modelling with experimental data, and predictive
   modelling with machine learning. We showcase BEFANA through a concrete
   example of a detrital soil food web of one agricultural grassland, and
   demonstrate all of its main components and functionalities.},

Title = {Decision analysis to guide recovery of the po'ouli, a critically

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {129},

Abstract = {We used a probabilistic decision tree to help select among alternative
   recovery strategies for the Po'ouli, a critically endangered forest bird
   endemic to the Hawaiian island of Maui. The Po'ouli is one of the rarest
   birds in the world, with only three individuals known, and no breeding
   pairs. The most urgent conservation need for the species is to create a
   breeding pair and obtain eggs for captive propagation. Seven recovery
   strategies had been proposed, and there was disagreement among
   conservation workers about which strategy to pursue. In addition to
   lengthy discussions, a decision tree was introduced to provide an
   objective way of quantifying the chance of success under each
   alternative. All available information was used to attempt evaluation of
   each node in the decision tree. The overall chance of obtaining eggs was
   calculated by multiplying estimates at each node under each alternative.
   All options produced low estimates of potential success, but two
   options, removal of all birds to captivity and placement of the birds in
   a field aviary in an accessible location, produced similar estimates of
   success. The US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Hawaii Division of
   Forestry and Wildlife eventually agreed that removal to captivity was
   the preferred alternative because it could be implemented quickly, which
   was important considering the advanced age of the birds, and would make
   it easier to provide veterinary care and ensure their safety from
   predators, severe weather, and vandals. Decision trees and other
   structured models should not be relied on exclusively, but they can
   provide an objective method of helping to make difficult conservation
   decisions and provide a record of complex thought processes used in
   reaching a determination. The case of the Po'ouli may serve as a
   template for navigation towards a decision to recover other species of
   extreme rarity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Search and foraging behaviors from movement data: A comparison of
   methods},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Search behavior is often used as a proxy for foraging effort within
   studies of animal movement, despite it being only one part of the
   foraging process, which also includes prey capture. While methods for
   validating prey capture exist, many studies rely solely on behavioral
   annotation of animal movement data to identify search and infer prey
   capture attempts. However, the degree to which search correlates with
   prey capture is largely untested. This study applied seven behavioral
   annotation methods to identify search behavior from GPS tracks of
   northern gannets (Morus bassanus), and compared outputs to the
   occurrence of dives recorded by simultaneously deployed time-depth
   recorders. We tested how behavioral annotation methods vary in their
   ability to identify search behavior leading to dive events. There was
   considerable variation in the number of dives occurring within search
   areas across methods. Hidden Markov models proved to be the most
   successful, with 81\% of all dives occurring within areas identified as
   search. k-Means clustering and first passage time had the highest rates
   of dives occurring outside identified search behavior. First passage
   time and hidden Markov models had the lowest rates of false positives,
   identifying fewer search areas with no dives. All behavioral annotation
   methods had advantages and drawbacks in terms of the complexity of
   analysis and ability to reflect prey capture events while minimizing the
   number of false positives and false negatives. We used these results,
   with consideration of analytical difficulty, to provide advice on the
   most appropriate methods for use where prey capture behavior is not
   available. This study highlights a need to critically assess and
   carefully choose a behavioral annotation method suitable for the
   research question being addressed, or resulting species management
   frameworks established.},

Abstract = {Landscape morphology of a watershed plays an important role on
   determination of the ecological health in the stream or river
   ecosystems. A habitat-riparian index system (HIS) is a newly developed
   metric to estimate stream naturalness in Korea. In this study, we focus
   on a predictive assessment of the HIS associated with stream integrity,
   and then aim to evaluate essential features of the stream integrity in
   conjunction with ambient land use patterns obtained from geographical
   information system (GIS). Concerning the stream health assessment, we
   applied a decision-tree model to the HIS prediction. As a results, the
   best models of the decision-trees exhibited a 72.2\% accuracy in
   prediction of the stream health index, and also a 65.8\% accuracy in
   classifying river catchments. A hierarchical structure of the
   decision-tree models in effect, was able to identify and classify more
   influential land use patterns that could reflex stream integrity. We
   highlight that GIS-involved analyses and approaches accommodates a wide
   variety of benefits in a rapid assessment of ecological data associated
   with field measurements. Furthermore, such methodological applications
   will be able to become an effective alternative for efficient ecological
   health assessment in streams and rivers.},

Title = {Robust and simplified machine learning identification of pitfall
   trap-collected ground beetles at the continental scale},

Abstract = {1. Insect populations are changing rapidly, and monitoring these changes
   is essential for understanding the causes and consequences of such
   shifts. However, large-scale insect identification projects are
   time-consuming and expensive when done solely by human identifiers.
   Machine learning offers a possible solution to help collect insect data
   quickly and efficiently.
   2. Here, we outline a methodology for training classification models to
   identify pitfall trap-collected insects from image data and then apply
   the method to identify ground beetles (Carabidae). All beetles were
   collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a
   continental scale ecological monitoring project with sites across the
   United States. We describe the procedures for image collection, image
   data extraction, data preparation, and model training, and compare the
   performance of five machine learning algorithms and two classification
   methods (hierarchical vs. single-level) identifying ground beetles from
   the species to subfamily level. All models were trained using
   pre-extracted feature vectors, not raw image data. Our methodology
   allows for data to be extracted from multiple individuals within the
   same image thus enhancing time efficiency, utilizes relatively simple
   models that allow for direct assessment of model performance, and can be
   performed on relatively small datasets.
   3. The best performing algorithm, linear discriminant analysis (LDA),
   reached an accuracy of 84.6\% at the species level when naively
   identifying species, which was further increased to >95\% when
   classifications were limited by known local species pools. Model
   performance was negatively correlated with taxonomic specificity, with
   the LDA model reaching an accuracy of similar to 99\% at the subfamily
   level. When classifying carabid species not included in the training
   dataset at higher taxonomic levels species, the models performed
   significantly better than if classifications were made randomly. We also
   observed greater performance when classifications were made using the
   hierarchical classification method compared to the single-level
   classification method at higher taxonomic levels.
   4. The general methodology outlined here serves as a proof-of-concept
   for classifying pitfall trap-collected organisms using machine learning
   algorithms, and the image data extraction methodology may be used for
   nonmachine learning uses. We propose that integration of machine
   learning in large-scale identification pipelines will increase
   efficiency and lead to a greater flow of insect macroecological data,
   with the potential to be expanded for use with other noninsect taxa.},

Title = {Three-Dimensional Quantification of Copepods Predictive Distributions in

Abstract = {Zooplankton is a fundamental group in aquatic ecosystems representing
   the base of the food chain. It forms a link between the lower trophic
   levels with secondary consumers and shows marked fluctuations in
   populations with environmental change, especially reacting to heating
   and water acidification. Marine copepods account for approx. 70\% of the
   abundance of zooplankton and are a target of monitoring activities in
   key areas such as the Southern Ocean. In this study, we have used
   FAIR-inspired legacy data (dating back to the 1980s) collected in the
   Ross Sea by the Italian National Antarctic Program at GBIF.org. Together
   with other open-access GIS data sources and tools, it allows one to
   generate, for the first time, three-dimensional predictive distribution
   maps for twenty-six copepod species. These predictive maps were obtained
   by applying machine learning techniques to grey literature data, which
   were visualized in open-source GIS platforms. In a Species Distribution
   Modeling (SDM) framework, we used machine learning with three types of
   algorithms (TreeNet, RandomForest, and Ensemble) to analyze the presence
   and absence of copepods in different areas and depth classes as a
   function of environmental descriptors obtained from the Polar Macroscope
   Layers present in Quantartica. The models allow, for the first time, to
   map-predict the food chain per depth class in quantitative terms,
   showing the relative index of occurrence (RIO) in 3Dimensions and
   identifying the presence of each copepod species analyzed in the Ross
   Sea, a globally-relevant wilderness area of conservation concern. Our
   results show marked geographical preferences that vary with species and
   trophic strategy. This study demonstrates that machine learning is a
   successful method in accurately predicting the Antarctic copepod
   presence, also providing useful data to orient future sampling and the
   management of wildlife and conservation.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of past, present and future themes for
   research and management of riparian zones, often relating to papers
   within this Wetlands Special Feature. Riparian research expanded in the
   United States around 1980 with themes that recognized (1) damage from
   excessive livestock, or (2) damage from river damming and diversion, and
   (3) the beneficial capacity of riparian buffers to intercept and
   assimilate nutrients and other water contaminants. Research expanded
   globally in the 1990s, with themes including (4) plant life history
   requirements and (5) reliance on fluvial geomorphic dynamics that enable
   riparian rejuvenation. Resource managers recognized that riparian areas
   provide (6) rich wildlife habitats (7) along with valued ecosystem
   services, (8) which encouraged conservation and restoration initiatives,
   (9) including environmental flow regimes. Floodplains are (10)
   vulnerable to invasive plants and management has included biocontrol
   such as for Tamarix in the American Southwest. Into the twenty-first
   century, (11) climate change is advancing, and riparian ecosystems may
   be especially impacted due to the compound challenges from increasing
   water demand and declining summer flows. As an emerging opportunity,
   (12) while reservoirs submerge floodplain vegetation, reservoir deltas
   may support compensatory riparian wetlands. (13) Studies increasingly
   utilize remote sensing tools including satellite imagery, LiDAR and
   unmanned aircraft systems, and (14) the coordination of large data sets
   invites digital ecology, including artificial intelligence and machine
   learning. Since riparian zones are centres for human activities, (15)
   there are opportunities for citizen science, social media and internet
   applications, which will increasingly democratize riparian research and
   management.},

Title = {Let's do the time warp again: non-linear time series matching as a tool
   for sequentially structured data in ecology},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ecological patterns are often fundamentally chronological. However,
   generalization of data is necessarily accompanied by a loss of detail or
   resolution. Temporal data in particular contain information not only in
   data values but in the temporal structure, which is lost when these
   values are aggregated to provide point estimates. Dynamic time warping
   (DTW) is a time series comparison method that is capable of efficiently
   comparing series despite temporal offsets that confound other methods.
   The DTW method is both efficient and remarkably flexible, capable of
   efficiently matching not only time series but also any sequentially
   structured data set, which has made it a popular technique in machine
   learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytical tasks. DTW is
   rarely used in ecology despite the ubiquity of temporally structured
   data. As technological advances have increased the richness of
   small-scale ecological data, DTW may be an attractive analysis technique
   because it is able to utilize the additional information contained in
   the temporal structure of many ecological data sets. In this study, we
   use an example data set of high-resolution fish movement records
   obtained from otolith microchemistry to compare traditional analysis
   techniques with DTW clustering. Our results suggest that DTW is capable
   of detecting subtle behavioral patterns within otolith data sets which
   traditional data aggregation techniques cannot. These results provide
   evidence that the DTW method may be useful across many of the temporal
   data types commonly collected in ecology, as well other sequentially
   ordered ``pseudo time series{''} data such as classification of species
   by shape.},

Abstract = {Decades since the initial establishment of zebra mussels (Dreissena
   polymorpha) in North America, understanding and controlling the invasion
   of aquatic ecosystems continues to be a problem in continent-wide
   conservation and landscape management. While the high economic and
   conservation burden of this species makes accurate predictions of future
   invasions a research priority, forecasting is confounded by limited
   data, tenuous model assumptions, and the stochasticity of the invasion
   process. Using a new method for niche identification, we profiled
   invasion vulnerability for 1,017 lakes in the Great Lakes region of the
   Unites States. We used a nonparametric geoadditive regression model to
   test for effects of two water quality variables on the present
   distribution of zebra mussels. We then used the support vector data
   description (SVDD), a support vector machine for one-class
   classification, to estimate the boundary of the ecological niche. By
   disentangling niche estimation from distributional assumptions,
   computational niche models could be used to test an array of fundamental
   concepts in ecology and evolution, while species invasions forecasting
   is representative of the wide range of potential applications for niche
   identification in conservation and management.},

Abstract = {Space-based life support systems which include ecological components
   will rely on sophisticated hardware and software to monitor and control
   key system parameters. Autonomous closed artificial ecosystems are
   useful for research in numerous fields. We are developing a bioreactor
   designed to study both microbe-environment interactions and autonomous
   control systems. Currently we are investigating N-cycling and N-mass
   balance in closed microbial systems. The design features of the system
   involve real-time monitoring of physical parameters (e.g. temperature,
   light), growth solution composition (e.g. pH, NOx, CO2), cell density
   and the status of important hardware components. Control of key system
   parameters is achieved by incorporation of artificial intelligence
   software tools that permit autonomous decision-making by the instrument.
   These developments provide a valuable research tool for terrestrial
   microbial ecology, as well as a testbed for implementation of artificial
   intelligence concepts. Autonomous instrumentation will be necessary for
   robust operation of space-based life support systems, and for use on
   robotic spacecraft. Sample data acquired from the system, important

Abstract = {After decades of discussion, there is little consensus on the extent to
   which hybrids between endangered and nonendangered species should be
   protected by US law. As increasingly larger, genome-scale data sets are
   developed, we can identify individuals and populations with even trace
   levels of genetic admixture, making the `hybrid problem' all the more
   difficult. We developed a decision-tree framework for evaluating hybrid
   protection, including both the processes that produced hybrids
   (human-mediated or natural) and the ecological impact of hybrids on
   natural ecosystems. We then evaluated our decision tree for four case
   studies drawn from our own work and briefly discuss several other cases
   from the literature. Throughout, we highlight the management outcomes
   that our approach provides and the nuances of hybridization as a
   conservation problem.},

Title = {Transitioning Machine Learning from Theory to Practice in Natural
   Resources Management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {435},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Advances in sensing and computation have accelerated at unprecedented
   rates and scales, in turn creating new opportunities for natural
   resources managers to improve adaptive and predictive management
   practices by coupling large environmental datasets with machine learning
   (ML). Yet, to date, ML models often remain inaccessible to managers
   working outside of academic research. To identify challenges preventing
   natural resources managers from putting ML into practice more broadly,
   we convened a group of 23 stakeholders (i.e., applied researchers and
   practitioners) who model and analyze data collected from environmental
   and agricultural systems. Workshop participants shared many barriers
   regarding their perceptions of, and experiences with, ML modeling. These
   barriers emphasized three main areas of concern: ML model transparency,
   availability of educational resources, and the role of process-based
   understanding in ML model development. Informed by workshop participant
   input, we offer recommendations on how the ecological modelling
   community can overcome key barriers preventing ML model use in natural
   resources management and advance the profession towards data-driven
   decision-making.},

Title = {Decision tree models for prediction of macroinvertebrate taxa in the

Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {399-411},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this study, decision tree models were induced to predict the habitat
   suitability of six macroinvertebrate taxa: Asellidae, Baetidae,
   Caenidae, Gammaridae, Gomphidae and Heptageniidae. The modelling
   techniques were applied on a dataset of 102 samples collected in 31
   sites along the river Axios in Northern Greece. The database consisted
   of eight physical-chemical and seven structural variables, as well as
   the abundances of 90 macroinvertebrate taxa. A seasonal variable was
   included allowing the description of potential temporal changes in the
   macroinvertebrate taxa. Rules relating the presence/absence of six
   benthic macroinvertebrate taxa with the 15 physical-chemical and
   structural river characteristics and the seasonal variable were induced
   using the J48 algorithm. In order to improve the performance and the
   interpretability of the induced models, three optimisation techniques
   were applied: tree-pruning, bagging and boosting. The predictive
   performance of the decision tree models was assessed on the basis of the
   percentage of Correctly Classified Instances (CCI) and the Cohen's kappa
   statistic. The results of the present study demonstrated that although
   the models had a relatively high predictive performance, noise in the
   dataset and inappropriate input variables prevented to some extent, the
   models from making reliable predictions. Although tree-pruning did not
   improve significantly the reliability of the induced models, it reduced
   considerably the tree complexity and in this way increased the
   transparency of the trees. Consequently, the induced models allowed for
   a correct ecological interpretation. The effect of bagging and boosting
   on the other hand varied considerably between the different models, as
   well as within different repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation in an
   individual model. In some cases the predictive performance was improved,
   in others stable or even worsened. The effect of bagging and boosting
   seemed to be strongly dependent on the dataset on which the two
   techniques were applied. Tree-pruning thus proved to have a high
   potential when applied in models used for decision-making of river
   restoration and conservation management.},

Abstract = {In the Pacific Islands, invertebrates including sea cucumbers are among
   the most valuable and vulnerable inshore fisheries resources. As human
   activities continue to force substantial impacts on coral reef
   ecosystems, the management of inshore fisheries has become an
   increasingly important priority. Knowledge of the distribution, biology
   and habitat requirements of a species can significantly enhance
   conservation efforts. The sea cucumber (Holothuria leucospilota) forms
   an important part of the traditional subsistence fishery on Rarotonga,
   Cook Islands, yet little is known of this species' present spatial
   distribution and abundance around the island.
   We apply two machine learning approaches and a classical statistical
   approach to predict the number of sea cucumber individuals from site
   characteristics. The machine learning methods used are induction of
   regression trees and instance-based learning. These are compared to the
   classical statistical approach of linear regression. The most accurate
   predictions are obtained using instance-based learning, while the most
   understandable descriptions are obtained using regression tree
   induction. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Forecasting changes to ecological communities is one of the central
   challenges in ecology. However, nonlinear dependencies, biotic
   interactions and data limitations have limited our ability to assess
   howpredictable communities are. Here, we used a machine learning
   approach and environmental monitoring data (biological, physical and
   chemical) to assess the predictability of phytoplankton celldensity in
   one lake across an unprecedented range of time-scales. Communities were
   highly predictable over hours to months: model R-2 decreased from 0.89
   at 4hours to 0.74 at 1month, and in a long-term dataset lacking fine
   spatial resolution, from 0.46 at 1month to 0.32 at 10years. When
   cyanobacterial and eukaryotic algal cell densities were examined
   separately, model-inferred environmental growth dependencies matched
   laboratory studies, and suggested novel trade-offs governing their
   competition. High-frequency monitoring and machine learning can set
   prediction targets for process-based models and help elucidate the
   mechanisms underlying ecological dynamics.},

Title = {Sounding the Call for a Global Library of Underwater Biological Sounds},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Aquatic environments encompass the world's most extensive habitats, rich
   with sounds produced by a diversity of animals. Passive acoustic
   monitoring (PAM) is an increasingly accessible remote sensing technology
   that uses hydrophones to listen to the underwater world and represents
   an unprecedented, non-invasive method to monitor underwater
   environments. This information can assist in the delineation of
   biologically important areas via detection of sound-producing species or
   characterization of ecosystem type and condition, inferred from the
   acoustic properties of the local soundscape. At a time when worldwide
   biodiversity is in significant decline and underwater soundscapes are
   being altered as a result of anthropogenic impacts, there is a need to
   document, quantify, and understand biotic sound sources-potentially
   before they disappear. A significant step toward these goals is the
   development of a web-based, open-access platform that provides: (1) a
   reference library of known and unknown biological sound sources (by
   integrating and expanding existing libraries around the world); (2) a
   data repository portal for annotated and unannotated audio recordings of
   single sources and of soundscapes; (3) a training platform for
   artificial intelligence algorithms for signal detection and
   classification; and (4) a citizen science-based application for public
   users. Although individually, these resources are often met on regional
   and taxa-specific scales, many are not sustained and, collectively, an
   enduring global database with an integrated platform has not been
   realized. We discuss the benefits such a program can provide, previous
   calls for global data-sharing and reference libraries, and the
   challenges that need to be overcome to bring together bio- and
   ecoacousticians, bioinformaticians, propagation experts, web engineers,
   and signal processing specialists (e.g., artificial intelligence) with
   the necessary support and funding to build a sustainable and scalable
   platform that could address the needs of all contributors and
   stakeholders into the future.},

Title = {Classifying behavior from short-interval biologging data: An example
   with GPS tracking of birds},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent advances in digital data collection have spurred accumulation of
   immense quantities of data that have potential to lead to remarkable
   ecological insight, but that also present analytic challenges. In the
   case of biologging data from birds, common analytical approaches to
   classifying movement behaviors are largely inappropriate for these
   massive data sets. We apply a framework for using K-means clustering to
   classify bird behavior using points from short time interval GPS tracks.
   K-means clustering is a well-known and computationally efficient
   statistical tool that has been used in animal movement studies primarily
   for clustering segments of consecutive points. To illustrate the utility
   of our approach, we apply K-means clustering to six focal variables
   derived from GPS data collected at 1-11 s intervals from free-flying
   bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) throughout the state of Iowa,
   USA. We illustrate how these data can be used to identify behaviors and
   life-stage- and age-related variation in behavior. After filtering for
   data quality, the K-means algorithm identified four clusters in >2
   million GPS telemetry data points. These four clusters corresponded to
   three movement states: ascending, flapping, and gliding flight; and one
   non-moving state: perching. Mapping these states illustrated how they
   corresponded tightly to expectations derived from natural history
   observations; for example, long periods of ascending flight were often
   followed by long gliding descents, birds alternated between flapping and
   gliding flight. The K-means clustering approach we applied is both an
   efficient and effective mechanism to classify and interpret
   short-interval biologging data to understand movement behaviors.
   Furthermore, because it can apply to an abundance of very short,
   irregular, and high-dimensional movement data, it provides insight into
   small-scale variation in behavior that would not be possible with many
   other analytical approaches.},

Title = {Using visualization and machine learning methods to monitor low
   detectability species-The least bittern as a case study},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Long duration acoustic monitoring is becoming an increasingly popular
   approach to extend survey effort by using autonomous sensors to
   passively collect data over large temporal and spatial scales. This is
   of particular benefit when attempting to detect a species whose temporal
   vocalization strategy is unknown, and whose small population size
   reduces detection probability. It is also of benefit in environments
   that are logistically difficult to access such as wetlands. We
   investigated the vocalization strategy of the Least Bittern (Ixobrychus
   exilis), a species of high conservation concern in the Western
   hemisphere and `in need of management' in multiple states of the USA.
   The Least Bittern is a secretive marsh bird that is primarily detected
   by its vocalizations and call-playback surveys are typically used for
   population monitoring. To minimize disturbance to both the birds and
   their habitat, we deployed autonomous acoustic recording units and
   collected continuous 24-hour audio recordings for 30 days. The resultant
   accumulation of data necessitated an automated method to assist with
   analysis and interpretation. We successfully applied a novel soundscape
   technique-long-duration, false-color (LDFC) spectrograms-to visually
   confirm presence of Least Bittern from the `coo coo coo' vocalization
   associated with breeding. In addition, we used a machine learning
   technique to automate the acoustic event detection process. Peak
   vocalization times were then predicted from an annotated dataset of
   actual calls and subsequently used to develop an optimal acoustic survey
   strategy. The results of this research demonstrate how machine learning
   methods can search large data sets for a specific species. This
   information can then be used to optimize existing monitoring methods, to
   increase detection probability and to minimize associated costs.},

Title = {Machine learning for accelerating process-based computation of land
   biogeochemical cycles},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Abstract = {Global change ecology nowadays embraces ever-growing large observational
   datasets (big-data) and complex mathematical models that track hundreds
   of ecological processes (big-model). The rapid advancement of the
   big-data-big-model has reached its bottleneck: high computational
   requirements prevent further development of models that need to be
   integrated over long time-scales to simulate the distribution of
   ecosystems carbon and nutrient pools and fluxes. Here, we introduce a
   machine-learning acceleration (MLA) tool to tackle this grand challenge.
   We focus on the most resource-consuming step in terrestrial biosphere
   models (TBMs): the equilibration of biogeochemical cycles (spin-up), a
   prerequisite that can take up to 98\% of the computational time. Through
   three members of the ORCHIDEE TBM family part of the IPSL Earth System
   Model, including versions that describe the complex interactions between
   nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon that do not have any analytical solution
   for the spin-up, we show that an unoptimized MLA reduced the computation
   demand by 77\%-80\% for global studies via interpolating the
   equilibrated state of biogeochemical variables for a subset of model
   pixels. Despite small biases in the MLA-derived equilibrium, the
   resulting impact on the predicted regional carbon balance over recent
   decades is minor. We expect a one-order of magnitude lower computation
   demand by optimizing the choices of machine learning algorithms, their
   settings, and balancing the trade-off between quality of MLA predictions
   and need for TBM simulations for training data generation and bias
   reduction. Our tool is agnostic to gridded models (beyond TBMs),
   compatible with existing spin-up acceleration procedures, and opens the
   door to a wide variety of future applications, with complex non-linear
   models benefit most from the computational efficiency.},

Title = {Exploring the connection between emergent animal personality and fitness
   using a novel individual-based model and decision tree approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The connection between reproductive fitness and animal personality is
   not fully understood. Using computer simulations and machine learning,
   we found high accuracy rules that predict which personalities are
   associated with fitness for two correlated measures of components of
   fitness applied a posteriori for classificatory purposes: fitness
   component (1) in terms of survival and short-term reproductive success,
   and fitness component (2) in terms of long term reproductive success
   which is indirectly related to survival of the parents. Animals are
   represented in the abstract as individuals with a genome that through
   time develops into certain characteristic behaviors and personalities.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulation study of its
   kind that extracts rules to investigate the link between personality and
   fitness. Clearly separated behaviors between fit and non-fit individuals
   emerged through the evolution of the population over time without
   top-down processing. Moreover, we did not employ a pre-defined fitness
   function, in order to minimize any possible biases toward a specific
   type of behavior. With respect to fitness component (1), we found that
   individuals with one of two extreme values of a personality trait
   (either bold or fearful) tend to be most fit, which agrees with
   empirical studies. With respect to fitness component (2), we found that
   when resources are low, fit individuals search for food whereas if food
   is abundant, they focus on reproduction, thereby suggesting the context
   dependence of fitness related behaviors. Once again, these results agree
   with empirical studies.},

Title = {Recommendations for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in climate
   projections of species distributions},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {22},
Pages = {6586-6601},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Projecting the future distributions of commercially and ecologically
   important species has become a critical approach for ecosystem managers
   to strategically anticipate change, but large uncertainties in
   projections limit climate adaptation planning. Although distribution
   projections are primarily used to understand the scope of potential
   change-rather than accurately predict specific outcomes-it is
   nonetheless essential to understand where and why projections can give
   implausible results and to identify which processes contribute to
   uncertainty. Here, we use a series of simulated species distributions,
   an ensemble of 252 species distribution models, and an ensemble of three
   regional ocean climate projections, to isolate the influences of
   uncertainty from earth system model spread and from ecological modeling.
   The simulations encompass marine species with different functional
   traits and ecological preferences to more broadly address resource
   manager and fishery stakeholder needs, and provide a simulated true
   state with which to evaluate projections. We present our results
   relative to the degree of environmental extrapolation from historical
   conditions, which helps facilitate interpretation by ecological modelers
   working in diverse systems. We found uncertainty associated with species
   distribution models can exceed uncertainty generated from diverging
   earth system models (up to 70\% of total uncertainty by 2100), and that
   this result was consistent across species traits. Species distribution
   model uncertainty increased through time and was primarily related to
   the degree to which models extrapolated into novel environmental
   conditions but moderated by how well models captured the underlying
   dynamics driving species distributions. The predictive power of
   simulated species distribution models remained relatively high in the
   first 30 years of projections, in alignment with the time period in
   which stakeholders make strategic decisions based on climate
   information. By understanding sources of uncertainty, and how they
   change at different forecast horizons, we provide recommendations for
   projecting species distribution models under global climate change.},

Title = {Digitizing the coral reef: Machine learning of underwater spectral
   images enables dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are the most biodiverse marine ecosystems, and host a wide
   range of taxonomic diversity in a complex spatial community structure.
   Existing coral reef survey methods struggle to accurately capture the
   taxonomic detail within the complex spatial structure of benthic
   communities. We propose a workflow to leverage underwater hyperspectral
   image transects and two machine learning algorithms to produce dense
   habitat maps of 1150 m(2) of reefs across the Curacao coastline. Our
   multi-method workflow labelled all 500+ million pixels with one of 43
   classes at taxonomic family, genus or species level for corals, algae,
   sponges, or to substrate labels such as sediment, turf algae and
   cyanobacterial mats. With low annotation effort (only 2\% of pixels) and
   no external data, our workflow enables accurate (Fbeta of 87\%)
   survey-scale mapping, with unprecedented thematic detail and with fine
   spatial resolution (2.5 cm/pixel). Our assessments of the composition
   and configuration of the benthic communities of 23 image transects
   showed high consistency. Digitizing the reef habitat and community
   structure enables validation and novel analysis of pattern and scale in
   coral reef ecology. Our dense habitat maps reveal the inadequacies of
   point sampling methods to accurately describe reef benthic communities.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring is the standard for environmental impact
   assessment of anthropogenic activities. Several recent studies showed
   that high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA
   metabarcoding) could overcome many limitations of the traditional
   morphotaxonomy-based bioassessment. Recently, we demonstrated that
   supervised machine learning (SML) can be used to predict accurate biotic
   indices values from eDNA metabarcoding data, regardless of the taxonomic
   affiliation of the sequences. However, it is unknown to which extent the
   accuracy of such models depends on taxonomic resolution of molecular
   markers or how SML compares with metabarcoding approaches targeting
   well-established bioindicator species. In this study, we address these
   issues by training predictive models upon five different ribosomal
   bacterial and eukaryotic markers and measuring their performance to
   assess the environmental impact of marine aquaculture on independent
   data sets. Our results show that all tested markers are yielding
   accurate predictive models and that they all outperform the assessment
   relying solely on taxonomically assigned sequences. Remarkably, we did
   not find any significant difference in the performance of the models
   built using universal eukaryotic or prokaryotic markers. Using any
   molecular marker with a taxonomic range broad enough to comprise
   different potential bioindicator taxa, SML approach can overcome the
   limits of taxonomy-based eDNA bioassessment.},

Title = {Fuzzy k-means classification of topo-climatic data as an aid to forest
   mapping in the Greater Yellowstone Area, USA},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Previous attempts to quantify topographic controls on vegetation have
   often been frustrated by issues concerning the number of variables of
   interest and the tendency of classification methods to create discrete
   classes though species have overlapping property sets (niches). Methods
   of fuzzy k-means classification have been used to address class overlap
   in ecological and geographical data but previously their usefulness has
   been limited when data sets are large or include artefacts that may
   occur through the derivation of topo-climatic attributes from gridded
   digital elevation models. This paper presents ways to overcome these
   limitations using GIS, spatial sampling methods, fuzzy k-means
   classification, and statistical modelling of the derived stream
   topology. Using data from a ca. 3600 km(2) forested site in the Greater
   Yellowstone Area, we demonstrate the creation of meaningful, spatially
   coherent topo-climatic classes through a fuzzy k-means classification of
   topo-climatic data derived from 100 m gridded digital elevation models
   (DEMs); these classes were successfully extrapolated to adjacent areas
   covering a total of ca. 10 000 km(2). Independently derived land cover
   data and middle infrared corrected Landsat TM derived estimates of
   Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (M-NDVI) at 575 independently
   sampled sites were used to evaluate the topo-climatic classes and test
   their extrapolation to the larger area. Relations between topo-climatic
   classes and land cover were tested by chi (2) analysis which
   demonstrated strong associations between topo-climatic class and 11 of
   the 15 cover classes. Relations between M\_NDVI and topo-climatic
   classes proved to be stronger than relations between M\_NDVI and the
   independent cover classes. We conclude that the fuzzy k-means procedure
   yields sensible and stable topo-climatic classes that can be used for
   the rapid mapping of large areas. The value of these methods for
   quantifying topographic controls on biodiversity and the strength of
   their relations with computed NDVI values warrant further investigation.},

Title = {An Artificial Intelligence Agent That Synthesises Visual Abstractions of
   Natural Forms to Support the Design of Human-Made Habitat Structures},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Biodiversity is in a state of global collapse. Among the main drivers of
   this crisis is habitat degradation that destroys living spaces for
   animals, birds, and other species. Design and provision of human-made
   replacements for natural habitat structures can alleviate this
   situation. Can emerging knowledge in ecology, design, and artificial
   intelligence (AI) help? Current strategies to resolve this issue include
   designing objects that reproduce known features of natural forms. For
   instance, conservation practitioners seek to mimic the function of
   rapidly disappearing large old trees by augmenting utility poles with
   perch structures. Other approaches to restoring degraded ecosystems
   employ computational tools to capture information about natural forms
   and use such data to monitor remediation activities. At present,
   human-made replacements of habitat structures cannot reproduce
   significant features of complex natural forms while supporting efficient
   construction at large scales. We propose an AI agent that can synthesise
   simplified but ecologically meaningful representations of 3D forms that
   we define as visual abstractions. Previous research used AI to
   synthesise visual abstractions of 2D images. However, current
   applications of such techniques neither extend to 3D data nor engage
   with biological conservation or ecocentric design. This article
   investigates the potential of AI to support the design of artificial
   habitat structures and expand the scope of computation in this domain
   from data analysis to design synthesis. Our case study considers
   possible replacements of natural trees. The application implements a
   novel AI agent that designs by placing three-dimensional cubes - or
   voxels - in the digital space. The AI agent autonomously assesses the
   quality of the resulting visual abstractions by comparing them with
   three-dimensional representations of natural trees. We evaluate the
   forms produced by the AI agent by measuring relative complexity and
   features that are meaningful for arboreal wildlife. In conclusion, our
   study demonstrates that AI can generate design suggestions that are
   aligned with the preferences of arboreal wildlife and can support the
   development of artificial habitat structures. The bio-informed approach
   presented in this article can be useful in many situations where
   incomplete knowledge about complex natural forms can constrain the
   design and performance of human-made artefacts.},

Title = {Comparison of Frameworks for Analyzing Social-ecological Systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {In this paper we compare 10 established frameworks for analyzing
   social-ecological systems. We limited ourselves to frameworks that were
   explicitly designed to be used by a wider community of researchers and
   practitioners. Although all these frameworks seem to have emerged from
   the need for concepts that permit structured, interdisciplinary
   reasoning about complex problems in social-ecological systems, they
   differ significantly with respect to contextual and structural criteria,
   such as conceptualization of the ecological and social systems and their
   interrelation. It appears that three main criteria suffice to produce a
   classification of frameworks that may be used as a decision tree when
   choosing a framework for analysis. These criteria are (i) whether a
   framework conceptualizes the relationship between the social and
   ecological systems as being uni- or bidirectional; (ii) whether it takes
   an anthropocentric or an ecocentric perspective on the ecological
   system; and (iii) whether it is an action-oriented or an
   analysis-oriented framework.},

Abstract = {This study tested the performance of 15 predictive models in predicting
   the distribution of sponge assemblages on the Australian continental
   shelf using a common set of marine environmental variables. The models
   included traditional regression and more recently developed machine
   learning models. The results demonstrate that the spatial distribution
   of sponge assemblages can be successfully predicted. although the
   effectiveness of predictions varied among models. Overall, machine
   learning models achieved the best prediction performance. The direct
   variable of bottom-water temperature and the resource variables that
   describe bottom-water nutrient status were found to be useful surrogates
   for the distribution of sponge assemblages at the broad regional scale.
   A new method of deriving pseudo-absence data (weighted pseudo-absence)
   was compared with random pseudo-absence data - the new data were able to
   improve modelling performance for all the models both in terms of
   statistics (similar to 10\%) and in the predicted spatial distributions.
   Results from this study will further refine modelling methods used to
   predict the spatial distribution of marine biota at broad spatial
   scales, an outcome especially relevant to managers of marine resources.

Title = {Desert locust detection using Earth observation satellite data in
   Mauritania},

Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Desert locust plagues have threatened food security in northern African
   countries for centuries. To prevent their effects, current early warning
   systems in arid environments need to be improved using the latest and
   most advanced modelling techniques and Earth observation datasets.
   Previous studies have analysed certain environmental predictors such as
   NDVI or soil moisture individually in an effort to detect suitable
   areas. However, we introduce new variables (Surface Temperature, LAI and
   Soil Moisture Root Zone) from the SMAP satellite and apply different
   machine learning methods in our species distribution model in order to
   identify desert locust presence. We obtain highly satisfactory model
   results (KAPPA \& TSS = 0.901 and ROC = 0.986) to detect the probability
   of presence and, hence, likely breeding areas based on environmental
   factors. The most relevant variables were surface temperature, NDVI and
   soil moisture at root zone under different time scenarios. This study
   also confirms the potential of the SMAP satellite to retrieve critical
   temperatures due to its time pass, in addition to reinforcing the NDVI
   product from MODIS as a reliable environmental predictor. These results
   demonstrate the validity of this new approach based on machine learning
   methods to identify favourable breeding areas in Mauritania.},

Title = {How does the use of industrial robots affect the ecological footprint?
   International evidence},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While the use of industrial robots (UIR) promotes economic growth, it
   inevitably also has an impact on the ecological environment. This
   research explores the relationship between UIR and ecological footprint
   based on data of 72 countries from 1993 to 2019. First, whether based on
   overall or sub-industry data we confirm that UIR reduces the ecological
   footprint. After considering a series of robustness tests such as sample
   self-selection bias and endogeneity, this conclusion still holds.
   Second, the mediation effect model shows that UIR reduces the ecological
   footprint through the time saving effect, green employment effect, and
   energy upgrading effect and increases the ecological footprint through
   the industry driving effect, and that the impact of UIR's reduction of
   the ecological footprint is dominant. Third, the moderating effect model
   shows that as the levels of economic development and human capital
   increase, UIR can more effectively reduce the ecological footprint.
   Fourth, in OECD countries and at a high quantile of the ecological
   footprint, the effect of UIR on reducing the ecological footprint is
   more obvious. This paper presents a new perspective for UIR to achieve
   economic development and ecological protection at the same time.
   Governments of various countries should actively seize the opportunity
   to develop industrial robots, continue to increase human capital
   investment, and accelerate the upgrade of energy sectors.},

Title = {Cluster analysis for two-level data sets: Classifying tree species from
   individual measurements},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Two-level data sets consist of higher level (say population) traits
   computed from lower level (say individual) observations. Cluster
   analysis for two-level data sets aims at classifying populations using
   individual observations. Most existing techniques to classify
   populations in two-level data sets actually operate on population traits
   (e.g. the k-means algorithm), thus disregarding the within-population
   individual variability. In this study, the k-means algorithm was
   compared with a recently developed classification method that accounts
   for within-population variability. Populations were tree species in a
   tropical rain forest in French Guiana, and individual observations were
   tree diameters and diameter growth rates. Tree species were classified
   according to either their diameter and growth rate, or to their
   asymptotic diameter distribution as predicted by an Usher matrix
   population model. In both cases, the k-means algorithm and the two-level
   classification method defined species clusters that were significantly
   related according to the Rand index. Nevertheless, clusters showed
   increasing differences between the two methods as the within-population
   individual variability increased. Whereas the k-means algorithm produced
   equally-sized spherical clusters, the two-level classification method
   adapted the size and shape of clusters to the individual
   within-population variability. Taking account of individual variability
   to classify populations in ecology may thus be important, albeit rarely
   done. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In an era of unprecedented human impacts on the planet, macrosystems
   biology (MSB) was developed to understand ecological patterns and

   machine-learning and qualitative literature review approaches to
   evaluate the thematic composition of MSB from articles published since
   the 2010 creation of the US National Science Foundation's MSB Program.
   The machine-learning analyses revealed that MSB articles studied scale
   and human components similarly to six ecology subdisciplines, indicating
   that MSB has deep ecological roots. A comparison with 84,841 ecological
   studies demonstrated that MSB has extended the knowledge space of
   ecology by examining large-scale patterns and processes alongside
   anthropogenic factors, which was also confirmed by the qualitative
   literature review approach. Our analyses indicated that MSB emphasizes
   large scales, has deep roots in ecological disciplines, and may emerge
   as a new research frontier, but this last point has yet to be proven.},

   we use for comparison with our results. One of the machine learning
   methods constructs a hierarchical structure similar to the one in the
   experts' model, while revealing some additional interesting relations of
   environmental features with respect to the number of spider species. The
   other method constructs a different hierarchy from the one proposed by
   the experts, which, according to our classification performance
   experiments, might be even more appropriate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Many cultivated species, such as oilseed rape, sunflower, wheat or
   sorghum can escape from crops, and colonize field margins as feral
   populations. The general processes leading to the escape and persistence
   of cultivated species on field margins are still poorly investigated. An
   exhaustive 4-year survey was conducted in the centre of France at a
   landscape level to study the origin of feral oilseed rape populations.
   We present here results obtained with machine learning methods, which
   are increasingly popular techniques for analysing large ecological
   datasets. As expected, the dynamics of feral populations relies on large
   seed immigration from fields and transport. However, the seed bank was
   shown to be the keystone of their persistence rather than local
   recruitment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of our seventh annual horizon scan, in
   which we aimed to identify issues that could have substantial effects on
   global biological diversity in the future, but are not currently widely
   well known or understood within the conservation community. Fifteen
   issues were identified by a team that included researchers,
   practitioners, professional horizon scanners, and journalists. The
   topics include use of managed bees as transporters of biological control
   agents, artificial superintelligence, electric pulse trawling,
   testosterone in the aquatic environment, building artificial oceanic
   islands, and the incorporation of ecological civilization principles
   into government policies in China.},

Title = {Constrained optimization of landscape indices in conservation planning
   to support ecological restoration in New Caledonia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {744-754},

Abstract = {Curbing habitat loss, reducing fragmentation and restoring connectivity
   are frequent concerns of conservation planning. In this respect, the
   incorporation of spatial constraints, fragmentation and connectivity
   indices into optimization procedures is an important challenge for
   improving decision support.
   Here we present a novel optimization approach developed to accurately
   represent a broad range of conservation planning questions with spatial
   constraints and landscape indices. Relying on constraint programming, a
   technique from artificial intelligence based on automatic reasoning,
   this approach provides both constraint satisfaction and optimality
   guarantees.
   We applied this approach in a real case study to support managers of the
   `Cote Oubliee - `Woen Vuu - Pwa Pereeu' provincial park project, in the
   biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia. Under budget, accessibility and
   equitable allocation constraints, we identified restorable areas optimal
   for reducing forest fragmentation and improving inter-patch structural
   connectivity, respectively measured with the effective mesh size and the
   integral index of connectivity.
   Synthesis and applications. Our work contributes to more effective and
   policy-relevant conservation planning by providing a spatially explicit
   and problem-focused optimization approach. By allowing an exact
   representation of spatial constraints and landscape indices, it can
   address new questions and ensure whether the solutions will be
   socio-economically feasible, through optimality and satisfiability
   guarantees. Our approach is generic and flexible, thus applicable to a
   wide range of conservation planning problems, such as ecological
   restoration planning, reserve or corridor design.},

Abstract = {It is known that microorganisms are essential for the functioning of
   ecosystems, but the extent to which microorganisms respond to different
   environmental variables in their natural habitats is not clear. In the
   current study, we present a methodological framework to quantify the
   covariation of the microbial community of a habitat and environmental
   variables of this habitat. It is built on theoretical considerations of
   systems ecology, makes use of state-of-the-art machine learning
   techniques and can be used to identify bioindicators. We apply the
   framework to a data set containing operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as
   well as more than twenty physicochemical and geographic variables
   measured in a large-scale survey of European lakes. While a large part
   of variation (up to 61\%) in many environmental variables can be
   explained by microbial community composition, some variables do not show
   significant covariation with the microbial lake community. Moreover, we
   have identified OTUs that act as ``multitask{''} bioindicators, i.e.,
   that are indicative for multiple environmental variables, and thus could
   be candidates for lake water monitoring schemes. Our results represent,
   for the first time, a quantification of the covariation of the lake
   microbiome and a wide array of environmental variables for lake
   ecosystems. Building on the results and methodology presented here, it
   will be possible to identify microbial taxa and processes that are
   essential for functioning and stability of lake ecosystems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {54-64},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Studies of common pool resources tend to neglect how aspects of the
   resource system interact with the external social, physical and
   institutional environment. We test the hypothesis that select market and
   non-market based options available to Mongolian Gobi Desert pastoralists
   in the current instiutional setting are not sufficient to ameliorate the
   risks of resource gaps caused by climatic and commodity price
   variability. An empirical decision tree was used to model interactions
   between climatic variability, commodity price volatility and economic
   returns. Results from the model were then discussed in light of a
   critical, qualitative analysis of risk management strategies and
   capabilities of pastoralists. Returns to pastoralists were dependent
   upon climate and commodity prices, as expected, but pastoralist
   decision-making could influence these returns. Pastoralist
   decision-making was further influenced by multi-scaled social, economic
   and climatic factors. Existing market-based options available to
   Mongolian Gobi Desert pastoralists reduced price, but not production,
   risks in this largely subsistent system. A focus on improving
   market-based options for reducing risk is likely to provide more
   benefits to livelihoods and landscape condition than modifying
   institutional settings governing access to the forage resource. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Integrating diverse concepts from animal behavior, movement ecology, and
   machine learning, we develop an overview of the ecology of learning and
   animal movement. Learning-based movement is clearly relevant to
   ecological problems, but the subject is rooted firmly in psychology,
   including a distinct terminology. We contrast this psychological origin
   of learning with the task-oriented perspective on learning that has
   emerged from the field of machine learning. We review conceptual
   frameworks that characterize the role of learning in movement, discuss
   emerging trends, and summarize recent developments in the analysis of
   movement data. We also discuss the relative advantages of different
   modeling approaches for exploring the learning-movement interface. We
   explore in depth how individual and social modalities of learning can
   matter to the ecology of animal movement, and highlight how diverse
   kinds of field studies, ranging from translocation efforts to
   manipulative experiments, can provide critical insight into the learning
   process in animal movement.},

   habitat patches), and further research is needed to integrate the
   behaviours in the estimation of movement parameters. In this respect,
   the day range (average daily distance travelled by an individual, DR) is
   a model parameter that relies on movement and behaviour. This study aims
   to provide a step forward concerning the use of camera-trapping in
   movement and behavioural ecology.
   We describe a machine learning procedure to differentiate movement
   behaviours from camera-trap data, and revisit the approach to consider
   different behaviours in the estimation of DR. Second, working within a
   simulated framework we tested the performance of three approaches to
   estimate DR: DROB (i.e. estimating DR without behavioural
   identification), DRTB (i.e. estimating DR by identifying behaviours
   manually and weighting each behaviour on the basis of the encounter rate
   obtained) and DRRB (i.e. estimating DR based on the classification of
   movement behaviours by a machine learning procedure and the ratio
   between speeds). Finally, we evaluated these approaches for 24 wild
   mammal species with different behavioural and ecological traits.
   The machine learning procedure to differentiate behaviours showed high
   accuracy (mean = 0.97). The DROB approach generated accurate results in
   scenarios with a speed-ratio (fast relative to slow behaviours) lower
   than 10, and for scenarios in which the animals spend most of the
   activity period on the slow behaviour. However, when considering
   movement behaviours to estimate DR is mandatory to include in the
   formulation the speed ratio, otherwise the DR results will be biased.
   The new approach, DRRB, generated accurate results in all the scenarios.
   The results obtained from real populations were consistent with the
   simulations.
   In conclusion, the integration of behaviours and speed-ratio in
   camera-trap studies makes it possible to obtain unbiased DR. Speed-ratio
   should be considered so that fast behaviour is not overrepresented. The
   procedures described in this work extend the applicability of
   camera-trap-based approaches in both movement and behavioural ecology.},

Abstract = {Information about the spatial distribution of species lies at the heart
   of many important questions in ecology. Logistical limitations and
   collection biases, however, limit the availability of such data at
   ecologically relevant scales. Remotely sensed information can alleviate
   some of these concerns, but presents challenges associated with accurate
   species identification and limited availability of field data for
   validation, especially in high diversity ecosystems such as tropical
   forests.
   Recent advances in machine learning offer a promising and cost-efficient
   approach for gathering a large amount of species distribution data from
   aerial photographs. Here, we propose a novel machine learning framework,
   artificial perceptual learning (APL), to tackle the problem of weakly
   supervised pixel-level mapping of tree species in forests. Challenges
   arise from limited availability of ground labels for tree species, lack
   of precise segmentation of tree canopies and misalignment between
   visible canopies in the aerial images and stem locations associated with
   ground labels. The proposed APL framework addresses these challenges by
   constructing a workflow using state-of-the-art machine learning
   algorithms.
   We develop and illustrate the proposed framework by implementing a
   fine-grain mapping of three species, the palm Prestoea acuminata and the
   tree species Cecropia schreberiana and Manilkara bidentata, over a
   5,000-ha area of El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. These
   large-scale maps are based on unlabelled high-resolution aerial images
   of unsegmented tree canopies. Misaligned ground-based labels, available
   for <1\% of these images, serve as the only weak supervision. APL
   performance is evaluated using ground-based labels and high-quality
   human segmentation using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and compared to a basic
   workflow that relies solely on labelled images.
   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Intersection over
   Union (IoU) metrics demonstrate that APL substantially outperforms the
   basic workflow and attains human-level cognitive economy, with 50-fold
   time savings. For the palm and C. schreberiana, the APL framework has
   high pixelwise accuracy and IoU with reference to human segmentations.
   For M. bidentata, APL predictions are congruent with ground-based
   labels. Our approach shows great potential for leveraging existing data
   from global forest plot networks coupled with aerial imagery to map tree
   species at ecologically meaningful spatial scales.},

Title = {MULTI-TARGET MODELLING OF THE DIATOM DIVERSITY INDICES IN LAKE PRESPA},
Journal = {APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {520-529},
Abstract = {In this paper we present models of relationship between the diatoms
   community diversity indices (DIs) and the physico-chemical parameters
   using machine learning techniques. By taking relative abundances into
   account, a diversity index depends not only on species richness but also
   on the evenness, or equitability, with which individuals are distributed
   among the different time and space. Diversity indices provide important
   information about rarity and commonness of species in a community.
   Because the physical-chemical conditions of the environmental influence
   on the several diversity indices of the diatoms community at once, it is
   more reliably to model all the diversity indices together.
   For modelling of the DIs models we use the raw; as measured, values of
   the concentrations for the physical-chemical parameters and the
   diversity indices of the diatoms abundance. The well known machine
   learning techniques are used to express this relationship: regression
   trees (RTs) and multi-target regression trees (MTRT's). The MTRT are
   more general than the RT, which predictive target is only one variable.
   The diversity indices are calculated for all diatoms of one measurement
   for 16 months, monthly and then are placed with the given
   physico-chemical parameters in one table. The results from the model
   have captured the ecological information with correlation between 0.9
   and 0.92 for unseen (test) data. Diversity indices have proved to be a
   reliable indicator for the influence of the environment on the diatoms
   community. Temperature and conductivity components together with the Zn
   concentration are most influenced factors on the diatoms biodiversity.
   This could lead to more widely research broad view in this direction of
   ecological modelling.},

Abstract = {Network ecology holds great promise as an approach to modelling and
   predicting the effects of agricultural management on ecosystem service
   provision, as it bridges the gap between community and ecosystem
   ecology. Unfortunately, trophic interactions between most species in
   agricultural farmland are not well characterised empirically, and only
   partial food webs are available for a few systems. Large agricultural
   datasets of the nodes (i.e., species) in the webs are now available, and
   if these can be enriched with information on the links between them then
   the current shortage of network data can potentially be overcome. We
   demonstrate that a logic-based machine learning method can be used to
   automatically assign interactions between nodes, thereby generating
   plausible and testable food webs from ecological census data. Many of
   the learned trophic links were corroborated by the literature: in
   particular, links ascribed with high probability by machine learning
   corresponded with those having multiple references in the literature. In
   some cases, previously unobserved but high probability links were
   suggested and subsequently confirmed by other research groups. We
   evaluate these food webs using a new cross-validation method and present
   new results on automatic corroboration of a large, complex food web. The
   simulated frequencies of trophic links were also correlated with the
   total number of literature `hits' for these links from the automatic
   corroboration. Finally, we also show that a network constructed by
   learning trophic links between functional groups is at least as accurate
   as the species-based trophic network.},

Title = {A hierarchical machine learning framework for the analysis of large
   scale animal movement data},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {Background In recent years the field of movement ecology has been
   revolutionized by our ability to collect high-accuracy, fine scale
   telemetry data from individual animals and groups. This growth in our
   data collection capacity has led to the development of statistical
   techniques that integrate telemetry data with random walk models to
   infer key parameters of the movement dynamics. While much progress has
   been made in the use of these models, several challenges remain. Notably
   robust and scalable methods are required for quantifying parameter
   uncertainty, coping with intermittent location fixes, and analysing the
   very large volumes of data being generated. Methods In this work we
   implement a novel approach to movement modelling through the use of
   multilevel Gaussian processes. The hierarchical structure of the method
   enables the inference of continuous latent behavioural states underlying
   movement processes. For efficient inference on large data sets, we
   approximate the full likelihood using trajectory segmentation and sample
   from posterior distributions using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
   Carlo methods. Results While formally equivalent to many continuous-time
   movement models, our Gaussian process approach provides flexible,
   powerful models that can detect multiscale patterns and trends in
   movement trajectory data. We illustrate a further advantage to our
   approach in that inference can be performed using highly efficient,
   GPU-accelerated machine learning libraries. Conclusions Multilevel
   Gaussian process models offer efficient inference for large-volume
   movement data sets, along with the fitting of complex flexible models.
   Applications of this approach include inferring the mean location of a
   migration route and quantifying significant changes, detecting diurnal
   activity patterns, or identifying the onset of directed persistent
   movements.},

Abstract = {Machine learning is used to predict extinction risk for 1,381 palm
   species, allowing identification of priority regions for palm
   conservation and cases where substitution with non-threatened species
   could provide products for human use.
   Protecting nature's contributions to people requires accelerating
   extinction risk assessment and better integrating evolutionary,
   functional and used diversity with conservation planning. Here, we
   report machine learning extinction risk predictions for 1,381 palm
   species (Arecaceae), a plant family of high socio-economic and
   ecological importance. We integrate these predictions with published
   assessments for 508 species (covering 75\% of all palm species) and we
   identify top-priority regions for palm conservation on the basis of
   their proportion of threatened evolutionarily distinct, functionally
   distinct and used species. Finally, we explore palm use resilience to
   identify non-threatened species that could potentially serve as
   substitutes for threatened used species by providing similar products.
   We estimate that over a thousand palms (56\%) are probably threatened,
   including 185 species with documented uses. Some regions (New Guinea,
   Vanuatu and Vietnam) emerge as top ten priorities for conservation only
   after incorporating machine learning extinction risk predictions.
   Potential substitutes are identified for 91\% of the threatened used
   species and regional use resilience increases with total palm richness.
   However, 16 threatened used species lack potential substitutes and 30
   regions lack substitutes for at least one of their threatened used palm
   species. Overall, we show that hundreds of species of this keystone
   family face extinction, some of them probably irreplaceable, at least
   locally. This highlights the need for urgent actions to avoid major
   repercussions on palm-associated ecosystem processes and human
   livelihoods in the coming decades.},

Abstract = {AimThe unsupervised nature of traditional numerical methods used to
   classify vegetation hinders the development of comprehensive vegetation
   classification systems. Each new unsupervised classification yields
   partitions that are partly inconsistent with previous classifications
   and change group membership for some sites. In contrast, supervised
   methods account for previously established vegetation units, but cannot
   define new ones. Therefore, we introduce the concept of semi-supervised
   classification to community ecology and vegetation science.
   Semi-supervised classification formally reproduces the existing units in
   a supervised mode and simultaneously identifies new units among
   unassigned sites in an unsupervised mode. We discuss the concept of
   semi-supervised clustering, introduce semi-supervised variants of two
   clustering algorithms that produce groups with crisp boundaries, k-means
   and partitioning around medoids (PAM), provide a free software tool to
   perform these classifications and demonstrate the advantages using
   example data sets of vegetation plots.
   MethodsSemi-supervised methods use a priori information about group
   membership for some sites to define centroids (k-means) or medoids (PAM)
   of site groups that represent previously established vegetation units.
   They identify these groups in a species hyperspace and assign new sites
   to them. At the same time, they search for a user-defined number of new
   groups. We compared the unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised
   methods using an example of a forest vegetation data set that was
   previously classified using expert knowledge, and assessed how well
   these methods reproduced vegetation units defined by experts. Then we
   compared supervised and semi-supervised methods in a task when a
   grassland vegetation classification established in one country was
   extended to two neighbouring countries.
   Results and conclusionsExample analyses of vegetation plot data sets
   demonstrated that semi-supervised variants of k-means and PAM are
   extremely valuable tools for extending existing vegetation
   classifications while preserving previously defined vegetation units.
   They can be used both for identifying so far unrecognized vegetation
   types in the regions where a vegetation classification already exists
   and for extending a vegetation classification from a particular region
   to neighbouring regions with partly identical but partly different
   vegetation types. Both k-means and PAM provide site groups with crisp
   boundaries, which makes them a simpler alternative to fuzzy clustering
   methods.},

Abstract = {Even if European river management and restoration are largely supported
   by the use of reliable tools, these tools are most often
   ``generalist{''} and provide only initial leads of alteration sources.
   Acknowledging that young-of-the-year (YOY) fish assemblages are highly
   dependent on riverine habitat conditions, the development of a YOY-based
   tool might be very useful or even essential in the design and
   implementation of conservation or restoration plan of large rivers, in
   measuring more straight-forward the losses and gains of hydro-ecological
   functionalities. In the past 20 years, new modeling techniques have
   emerged from a growing sophistication of statistical model applied to
   ecology. ``Machine learning methods{''} (ML) are now recognized as
   holding great promise for the advancement of understanding and
   prediction of ecological phenomena. The aim of this work was to select
   the appropriate statistical technique to model YOY assemblages according
   to different meso-scale habitat variables that are meaningful to
   planners. To do this, two ``Machine Learning{''} methods, Classification
   and Regression Trees (CART) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), were
   compared to Generalized Linear Models (GLM). We modeled the occurrence
   of 9 species from the Seine River basin (France) in order to compare
   models abilities to accurately predict the presence and absence of each
   species. BRT appeared to be the best technique for modeling 0+ fish
   occurrences in our dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum) is a tree native to China that
   successfully invades forests of central Argentina. To fully understand
   glossy privet's ecological effects on native forest, it is necessary to
   accurately map the distribution of glossy privet stands and the changes
   in biodiversity and forest structure of the invaded areas. The
   objectives of this paper were (1) to map the distribution of glossy
   privet stands in an area representative of the Sierras Chicas (Crdoba,
   Argentina) and (2) compare composition, structure and regeneration
   between glossy privet invaded stands and native forest stands. Using
   four Landsat TM images (October 2005, March, May and July 2006) we
   mapped the distribution of a glossy privet-dominated stand using a
   support vector machine, a non-parametric classifier. We recorded forest
   structure variables and tree diversity on 105 field plots. Glossy
   privet-dominated stands occupied 3,407 ha of the total forested land in
   the study area (27,758 ha), had an average of 33 glossy privet trees
   (dbh > 2.5 cm) per plot and the cover of their shrub and herb strata was
   substantially reduced compared with native forest. Forest regeneration
   was dominated by glossy privet in native forest stands adjacent to
   glossy privet-dominated stands. We conclude that in the Sierras Chicas
   glossy privet has become a widespread invader, changing the patterns of
   vertical structure, diversity, and regeneration in native forests.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, accelerometer (ACC) data have been
   increasingly used to study animal behaviours and energetics. However,
   the large amount of raw ACC data can be a burden to device storage and
   power consumption and in many cases may also require device retrieval
   for data collection. On-board data processing to reduce data volume and
   power consumption for data transmission may hold promise to alleviate
   these problems and allow for next-generation, smart trackers. We
   developed a tracking system processing raw ACC data on-board of trackers
   into behaviours using an XGBoost machine learning model. We used this
   system on six free-ranging Pacific black ducks Anas superciliosa to
   study eight behaviours every 2 s. The on-board XGBoost model for
   behaviour classification had 92.04\% overall accuracy. One day of
   continuous behaviour records was compressed on-board to as little as
   17.28 kB for routine transmission via the 3G network. We received
   behaviour data from the six ducks continuously for periods ranging
   between 56 days and 14 months. On-board processing of raw ACC data and
   data transmission proofed highly energy efficient and came at a minimal
   weight cost to the trackers, providing great potential to open up new
   areas in ecological and behavioural research.},

Abstract = {There is no agreed definition of intelligence, so it is problematic to
   simply ask whether brains, swarms, computers, or other systems are
   intelligent or not. To compare the potential intelligence exhibited by
   different cognitive systems, I use the common approach used by
   artificial intelligence and artificial life: Instead of studying the
   substrate of systems, let us focus on their organization. This
   organization can be measured with information. Thus, I apply an
   informationist epistemology to describe cognitive systems, including
   brains and computers. This allows me to frame the usefulness and
   limitations of the brain-computer analogy in different contexts. I also
   use this perspective to discuss the evolution and ecology of

Title = {Spherical k-means clustering is good for interpreting multivariate
   species occurrence data},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Pages = {542-551},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Clustering multivariate species data can be an effective way of showing
   groups of species or samples with similar characteristics. Most current
   techniques classify the samples first and then the species. A
   disadvantage of classifying the samples first is that relatively subtle
   differences between occurrence profiles of species can be obscured. The
   k-means method of clustering minimizes the sum of squared distances
   between cluster centres and cluster members. If the entities to be
   clustered are projected on the unit sphere, then a natural measure of
   dispersion is the sum of squared chord distances separating the entities
   from their cluster centres; k-means clustering with this measure of
   dispersion is called spherical k-means (SKM). We also consider a variant
   in which the sum of squared perpendicular distances to a central ray is
   minimized. Unweighted SKM is liable to produce clusters of very rare
   species. This feature can be avoided if each point on the unit sphere is
   weighted by the length of the ray that produced it. The standard SKM
   algorithm converges to very numerous local optima. To avoid this
   problem, we have developed a computationally intensive algorithm that
   uses multiple randomizations to select high-quality seed species. The
   species clustering can be used to define simplified attributes for the
   samples. If the samples are then classified using the same technique,
   the resulting matrix of clustered species and clustered samples provides
   a biclustering of the data. The strength of the relationship between
   clusters can be measured by their mutual information, which is
   effectively the entropy of the biclustering. The technique was tested on
   five ecological and biogeographical datasets ranging in size from 30
   species in 20 samples to 1405 species in 3857 samples. Several variants
   of SKM were compared, together with results from the established program
   Twinspan. When judged by entropy, SKM always performed adequately and
   produced the best clustering in all datasets but the smallest.},

   spatial distribution and size, as well as data on the landscape and
   ecological properties (GIS) of the area inhabited by this population, we
   develop a habitat suitability model by automated data analysis using
   machine learning of classification trees. We assume that the recorded
   observations of deer approximate the actual spatial distribution of the
   deer population reasonably well. The habitat suitability models for
   individual animals have the form of classification trees. The induced
   trees are interpreted by domain experts and a generic model is proposed.
   The generic habitat suitability models can help determine potential
   unoccupied habitats for the red deer population and develop guidelines
   for managing the development of the red deer population and its
   influence on the environment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Repeated emergence of zoonotic viruses from bat reservoirs into human
   populations demands predictive approaches to preemptively identify
   virus-carrying bat species. Here, we use machine learning to examine
   drivers of viral diversity in bats, determine whether those drivers
   depend on viral genome type, and predict undetected viral carriers. Our
   results indicate that bat species with longer life spans, broad
   geographic distributions in the eastern hemisphere, and large group
   sizes carry more viruses overall. Life span was a stronger predictor of
   deoxyribonucleic acid viral diversity, while group size and family were
   more important for predicting ribonucleic acid viruses, potentially
   reflecting broad differences in infection duration. Importantly, our
   models predict 54 bat species as likely carriers of zoonotic viruses,
   despite not currently being considered reservoirs. Mapping these
   predictions as a proportion of local bat diversity, we identify global
   regions where efforts to reduce disease spillover into humans by
   identifying viral carriers may be most productive.},

Abstract = {In the present study, classification trees (CTs) and support vector
   machines (SVMs) were used to study habitat suitability for 30
   macroinvertebrate taxa in the Du river in Northern Vietnam The
   presence/absence of the 30 most common macroinvertebrate taxa was
   modelled based on 21 physical-chemical and structural variables. The
   predictive performance of the CT and SVM models was assessed based on
   the percentage of Correctly Classified Instances (CCI) and Cohen's kappa
   statistics The results of the present study demonstrated that SVMs
   performed better than CTs Attribute weighing in SVMs could replace the
   application of genetic algorithms for input variable selection By
   weighing attributes. SVMs provided quantitative correlations between
   environmental variables and the occurrence of macroinvertebrates and
   thus allowed better ecological interpretation SVMs thus proved to have a
   high potential when applied for decision-making in the context of river

Title = {Mapping socio-ecological systems in Idaho: Spatial patterns and
   analytical considerations},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Policy interest in socio-ecological systems has driven attempts to
   define and map socio-ecological zones (SEZs), that is, spatial regions,
   distinguishable by their conjoined social and bio-geo-physical
   characteristics. The state of Idaho, USA, has a strong need for SEZ
   designations because of potential conflicts between rapidly increasing
   and impactful human populations, and proximal natural ecosystems. Our
   Idaho SEZs address analytical shortcomings in previously published SEZs
   by: (1) considering potential biases of clustering methods, (2)
   cross-validating SEZ classifications, (3) measuring the relative
   importance of bio-geo-physical and social system predictors, and (4)
   considering spatial autocorrelation. We obtained authoritative
   bio-geo-physical and social system datasets for Idaho, aggregated into
   5-km grids = 25 km(2), and decomposed these using principal components
   analyses (PCAs). PCA scores were classified using two clustering
   techniques commonly used in SEZ mapping: hierarchical clustering with
   Ward's linkage, and k-means analysis. Classification evaluators
   indicated that eight- and five-cluster solutions were optimal for the
   bio-geo-physical and social datasets for Ward's linkage, resulting in 31
   SEZ composite types, and six- and five-cluster solutions were optimal
   for k-means analysis, resulting in 24 SEZ composite types. Ward's and
   k-means solutions were similar for bio-geo-physical and social
   classifications with similar numbers of clusters. Further, both
   classifiers identified the same dominant SEZ composites. For rarer SEZs,
   however, classification methods strongly affected SEZ classifications,
   potentially altering land management perspectives. Our SEZs identify
   several critical regions of social-ecological overlap. These include
   suburban interface types and a high desert transition zone. Based on
   multinomial generalized linear models, bio-geo-physical information
   explained more variation in SEZs than social system data, after
   controlling for spatial autocorrelation, under both Ward's and k-means
   approaches. Agreement (cross-validation) levels were high for
   multinomial models with bio-geo-physical and social predictors for both
   Ward's and k-means SEZs. A consideration of historical drivers,
   including indigenous social systems, and current trajectories of land
   and resource management in Idaho, indicates a strong need for rigorous
   SEZ designations to guide development and conservation in the region.
   Our analytical framework can be broadly applied in SES research and
   applied in other regions, when categorical responses-including cluster
   designations-have a spatial component.},

Abstract = {On the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius, Coralita (Antigonon leptopus)
   is an aggressive invasive vine posing major biodiversity conservation
   concerns. The generation of distribution maps can address these
   conservation concerns by helping to elucidate the drivers of invasion.
   We test the use of support vector machines to map the distribution of
   Coralita on St. Eustatius at high spatial resolution and use this map to
   identify potential landscape and geomorphological factors associated
   with Coralita presence. This latter step was performed by comparing the
   actual distribution of Coralita patches to a random distribution of
   patches. To train the support vector machine algorithm, we used three
   vegetation indices and seven texture metrics derived from a 2014
   WorldView-2 image. The resulting map shows that Coralita covered 3.18\%
   of the island in 2014, corresponding to an area of 64 ha. The mapped
   distribution was highly accurate, with 93.2\% overall accuracy (Coralita
   class producer's accuracy: 76.4\%, user's accuracy: 86.2\%). Using this
   classification map, we found that Coralita is not randomly distributed
   across the landscape, occurring significantly closer to roads and
   drainage channels, in areas with higher accumulated moisture, and on
   flatter slopes. Coralita was found more often than expected in
   grasslands, disturbed forest, and urban areas but was relatively rare in
   natural forest. These results highlight the ability of high spatial
   resolution data from sensors such as WorldView-2 to produce accurate
   invasive species, providing valuable information for predicting current
   and future spread risks and for early detection and removal plans.

Title = {Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and the Promise of Phenomics in
   Ecology and Evolutionary Biology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {For centuries, ecologists and evolutionary biologists have used images
   such as drawings, paintings and photographs to record and quantify the
   shapes and patterns of life. With the advent of digital imaging,
   biologists continue to collect image data at an ever-increasing rate.
   This immense body of data provides insight into a wide range of
   biological phenomena, including phenotypic diversity, population
   dynamics, mechanisms of divergence and adaptation, and evolutionary
   change. However, the rate of image acquisition frequently outpaces our
   capacity to manually extract meaningful information from images.
   Moreover, manual image analysis is low-throughput, difficult to
   reproduce, and typically measures only a few traits at a time. This has
   proven to be an impediment to the growing field of phenomics - the study
   of many phenotypic dimensions together. Computer vision (CV), the
   automated extraction and processing of information from digital images,
   provides the opportunity to alleviate this longstanding analytical
   bottleneck. In this review, we illustrate the capabilities of CV as an
   efficient and comprehensive method to collect phenomic data in
   ecological and evolutionary research. First, we briefly review
   phenomics, arguing that ecologists and evolutionary biologists can
   effectively capture phenomic-level data by taking pictures and analyzing
   them using CV. Next we describe the primary types of image-based data,
   review CV approaches for extracting them (including techniques that
   entail machine learning and others that do not), and identify the most
   common hurdles and pitfalls. Finally, we highlight recent successful
   implementations and promising future applications of CV in the study of
   phenotypes. In anticipation that CV will become a basic component of the
   biologist's toolkit, our review is intended as an entry point for
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists that are interested in extracting
   phenotypic information from digital images.},

Abstract = {Aim Phenological models have become a vital tool for predicting future
   phenological responses to global climate change. Recently, machine
   learning (ML) has been used successfully to develop phenological models
   based on ground observations. However, fitting an observation series
   that has been observed for only a few years (or even a decade) can
   easily lead to overfitting, and it is still a great challenge to predict
   future phenology accurately based on a short observation series. Here,
   based on historical ground phenological observations, we construct an
   ML-based binary classification phenological model that can be applied to
   temperate trees. Innovation We thoroughly describe the construction
   process of a species-specific ML-based binary classification
   phenological model that is suitable for phenological predictions in both
   spring and autumn. Through experiments, we evaluate 18 commonly used ML
   classification algorithms and the effects of two parameters on the
   prediction performance of the model. Finally, we compare the performance
   between the binary classification model and six widely used
   ecophysiological models for accuracy of spring phenological prediction.
   Main conclusions The median root mean square error (RMSE) of the binary
   classification model for the first flowering date (93 observation
   series) was only 2.99 days, which proves that it is a good method of
   phenological prediction for temperate trees. This model can effectively
   overcome the insufficient sample size of ground observations for
   specific species and provide new insights of phenological predictions
   for tropical and subtropical trees. The comparison of different ML
   algorithms showed that the median root mean square errors of the six
   algorithms were <3.5 days, and lower than those of six ecophysiological
   models (>3.7 days) in prediction of spring phenology. In addition, this
   model can help us to infer plant physiological mechanisms and drivers of
   phenological change and provide more accurate predictions of plant
   phenological responses to climate change.},

Abstract = {The sex ratio is a key ecological demographic parameter crucial for
   population viability. However, the epigenetic mechanisms operating
   during gonadal development regulating gene expression and the sex ratio
   remain poorly understood. Moreover, there is interest in the development
   of epigenetic markers associated with a particular phenotype or as
   sentinels of environmental effects. Here, we profiled DNA methylation
   and gene expression of 10 key genes related to sex development and
   stress, including steroidogenic enzymes, and growth and transcription
   factors. We provide novel information on the sex-related differences and
   on the influence of elevated temperature on these genes in zebrafish, a
   species with mixed genetic and environmental influences on sex ratios.
   We identified both positive (e.g., amh, cyp11c and hsd11b2) and negative
   (e.g., cyp11a1 and dmrt1) correlations in unexposed males, and negative
   correlation (amh) in exposed females between DNA methylation and gene
   expression levels. Further, we combined DNA methylation analysis with
   machine learning procedures and found a series of informative CpGs
   capable not only of correctly identifying sex (based on cyp19a1a DNA
   methylation levels) but also of identifying whether males and females
   had been exposed to abnormally elevated temperature when young (based on
   amh and foxl2a DNA methylation levels, respectively). This was achieved
   in the absence of conspicuous morphological alterations of the gonads.
   These DNA methylation-based epigenetic biomarkers represent molecular
   resources that can correctly recapitulate past thermal history and pave
   the way for similar findings in other species to assess potential
   ecological effects of environmental disturbances in the context of
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Tropical biomes are the most diverse plant communities on Earth, and
   quantifying this diversity at large spatial scales is vital for many
   purposes. As macroecological approaches proliferate, the taxonomic
   uncertainties in species occurrence data are easily neglected and can
   lead to spurious findings in downstream analyses. Here, we argue that
   technological approaches offer potential solutions, but there is no
   single silver bullet to resolve uncertainty in plant biodiversity
   quantifi-cation. Instead, we propose the use of artificial intelligence
   (AI) approaches to build a data-driven framework that integrates several
   data sources - including spectroscopy, DNA sequences, image recognition,
   and morphological data. Such a framework would provide a foundation for
   improving species identification in macroecological analyses while
   simultaneously improving the taxonomic process of species delimitation.},

Abstract = {We modelled the distribution of soil properties across the agricultural
   zone on the Australian continent using data mining and knowledge
   discovery from databases (DM\&KDD) tools. Piecewise linear tree models
   were built choosing from 19 climate variables, digital elevation model
   (DEM) and derived terrain attributes, four Landsat multi-spectral
   scanner (MSS) bands, land use and lithology maps as predictors of
   topsoil and subsoil pH, organic C, \% clay, and total N and P. The
   actual geographic location of the sampled soil data points was not used
   as a predictor. Classification trees were used to estimate topsoil and
   subsoil horizon thickness and texture class using similar predictors.
   That maps could be made using the decision tree models attests to the
   occurrence of knowledge discovery from the soil point databases used as
   training data. The decision tree models were evaluated and interpreted
   in a spatial context by: (1) tabulation of variables selected by the
   tree models; (2) mapping of the extent over which individual predictors
   were used and their thresholds; and (3) mapping of the extent over which
   combinations of predictors were used. The evaluation and interpretation
   process indicates that the models are consistent with general principles
   of soil genesis and that detailed investigation of the models' structure
   in a spatial context may have other uses in biogeographical studies and
   geo-ecological process modelling. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Salinity gradients across estuaries influence wetland carbon storage,
   methane (CH4) biogeochemistry, and plant productivity. Estuarine
   freshwater wetlands may experience increases in salinity during drought;
   however, the impact of salinization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is
   uncertain. We measured ecosystem-scale GHG emissions from a wetland
   experiencing salinization during the 2011-2017 California drought and
   used information theory analyses to quantify couplings and causal
   interactions between CH4 fluxes and two dominant environmental drivers;
   gross ecosystem photosynthesis and temperature. Machine learning models
   were then used to estimate salinization-induced changes in CH4 fluxes
   and plant productivity. We observed dynamic CH4 flux-driver
   relationships across the salinization disturbance event, where
   temperature connections strengthened, and productivity connections
   dampened during salinization. Annual gross ecosystem productivity
   reduced by 64\% during peak salinization, whereas annual CH4 emissions
   only reduced by 10\%, suggesting that other CH4 substrate sources
   compensated for reductions in recent photosynthate. Our results
   demonstrate the value of applying information theory and machine
   learning approaches to ecological analyses and suggest that
   drought-induced salinization may increase GHG emissions from estuarine
   freshwater wetlands.},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Given increasing access to large amounts of biodiversity information, a
   powerful capability is that of modeling ecological niches and predicting
   geographic distributions. Because, sampling species' distributions is
   costly, we explored sample size needs for accurate modeling for three
   predictive modeling methods via re-sampling of data for well-sampled
   species, and developed curves of model improvement with increasing
   sample size. In general, under a coarse surrogate model, and
   machine-learning methods, average success rate at predicting occurrence
   of a species at a location, or accuracy, was 90\% of maximum within ten
   sample points, and was near maximal at 50 data points. However, a fine
   surrogate model and logistic regression model had significantly lower
   rates of increase in accuracy with increasing sample size, reaching
   similar maximum accuracy at 100 data points. The choice of environmental
   variables also produced unpredictable effects on accuracy over the range
   of sample sizes on the logistic regression method, while the
   machine-learning method had robust performance throughout. Examining
   correlates of model performance across species, extent of geographic
   distribution was the only significant ecological factor. (C) 2002

Abstract = {The available potential ecological factors have been scored in the form
   of presence/absence in U.T.M. sqaures in Belgium. A correspondence
   analysis shows a strong underlying gradient in the data set which
   induces an extraordinary horsehoe effect. This gradient follows closely
   the altitude component. Applying the k-means clustering method on U.T.M.
   squares produces geographically compact groups which are largely
   hierarchically nested. This indicates strong regional trends in the
   ecological data set. As homogeneous groups may also be artefacts created
   by the clustering algorithms on a continuous gradient, the relevance of
   the borders between homogeneous areas is tested. In general, k-means
   borders correspond to the main breaking lines between adjacent U.T.M.
   squares. They can be referred to as natural borders.},

Title = {Modern Pyromes: Biogeographical Patterns of Fire Characteristics across
   the Contiguous United States},
Journal = {FIRE-SWITZERLAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent decades, wildfires in many areas of the United States (U.S.)
   have become larger and more frequent with increasing anthropogenic
   pressure, including interactions between climate, land-use change, and
   human ignitions. We aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of
   contemporary fire characteristics across the contiguous United States
   (CONUS). We derived fire variables based on frequency, fire radiative
   power (FRP), event size, burned area, and season length from
   satellite-derived fire products and a government records database on a
   50 km grid (1984-2020). We used k-means clustering to create a
   hierarchical classification scheme of areas with relatively homogeneous
   fire characteristics, or modern `pyromes,' and report on the model with
   eight major pyromes. Human ignition pressure provides a key explanation
   for the East-West patterns of fire characteristics. Human-dominated
   pyromes (85\% mean anthropogenic ignitions), with moderate fire size,
   area burned, and intensity, covered 59\% of CONUS, primarily in the East
   and East Central. Physically dominated pyromes (47\% mean anthropogenic
   ignitions) characterized by relatively large (average 439 mean annual ha
   per 50 km pixel) and intense (average 75 mean annual megawatts/pixel)
   fires occurred in 14\% of CONUS, primarily in the West and West Central.
   The percent of anthropogenic ignitions increased over time in all
   pyromes (0.5-1.7\% annually). Higher fire frequency was related to
   smaller events and lower FRP, and these relationships were moderated by
   vegetation, climate, and ignition type. Notably, a spatial mismatch
   between our derived modern pyromes and both ecoregions and historical
   fire regimes suggests other major drivers for modern U.S. fire patterns
   than vegetation-based classification systems. This effort to delineate
   modern U.S. pyromes based on fire observations provides a national-scale
   framework of contemporary fire regions and may help elucidate patterns
   of change in an uncertain future.},

Title = {Estimating the vulnerability of fifteen tree species under changing

Abstract = {In the Pacific northwestern (PNW) region of North America, climatic
   conditions have significantly warmed since a predominantly cool phase of
   the Pacific North American circulation patterns between 1950 and 1975.
   What are the implications of this shift in climate for the vulnerability
   of native tree species? To address this question, we combined
   mechanistic and statistical models to assess where a variety of native
   tree species might be more vulnerable within their recorded ranges and
   where they might potentially migrate. For long-lived species that are
   well adapted to compete, seasonal differences in photosynthesis and
   water use offer insights helpful in predicting their distributions. To
   evaluate the general response of conifers to climatic variation across
   the region, we previously applied a process-based model (3-PG), to
   simulate the growth and maximum leaf area index that Douglas-fir could
   attain within recognized forested areas. We then constructed automated
   decision tree models to define and map the ecological distributions of
   15 tree species based on differences in how photosynthesis was
   constrained by drought, daytime temperatures, high evaporative demand,
   and the frequency of frost. For the baseline climate period (1950-1975),
   the decision tree models predicted presence and absence of each species
   at 23,000 observations with an average accuracy of 81\%, with an average
   kappa statistic of 0.74. In this paper the same models were run annually
   for the period between 1976 and 2006 for each species, and the areas
   defined as remaining suitable or becoming vulnerable to disturbance were
   identified based on whether more or less than half of the years fell
   within the originally defined limits. Based on these criteria, 70\% of
   the species recorded ranges remained suitable, with 30\% deemed
   vulnerable. Results varied notably by species with western red cedar and
   western hemlock remaining highly adapted, with potential for range
   expansion in area of up to 50\% relative to the baseline period. In
   contrast, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, grand, and noble fir were
   classified as vulnerable with potential net contractions in their
   ranges. The analysis was extended through the rest of the 21st century
   using climatic projections from the Canadian global circulation model
   with a high fossil fuel emission scenario (A2) and compared to other
   previously published species range predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A survival guide to Landsat preprocessing},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {98},
Number = {4},
Pages = {920-932},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Landsat data are increasingly used for ecological monitoring and
   research. These data often require preprocessing prior to analysis to
   account for sensor, solar, atmospheric, and topographic effects.
   However, ecologists using these data are faced with a literature
   containing inconsistent terminology, outdated methods, and a vast number
   of approaches with contradictory recommendations. These issues can, at
   best, make determining the correct preprocessing workflow a difficult
   and time-consuming task and, at worst, lead to erroneous results. We
   address these problems by providing a concise overview of the Landsat
   missions and sensors and by clarifying frequently conflated terms and
   methods. Preprocessing steps commonly applied to Landsat data are
   differentiated and explained, including georeferencing and
   co-registration, conversion to radiance, solar correction, atmospheric
   correction, topographic correction, and relative correction. We then
   synthesize this information by presenting workflows and a decision tree
   for determining the appropriate level of imagery preprocessing given an
   ecological research question, while emphasizing the need to tailor each
   workflow to the study site and question at hand. We recommend a
   parsimonious approach to Landsat preprocessing that avoids unnecessary
   steps and recommend approaches and data products that are well tested,
   easily available, and sufficiently documented. Our focus is specific to
   ecological applications of Landsat data, yet many of the concepts and
   recommendations discussed are also appropriate for other disciplines and
   remote sensing platforms.},

Title = {What's wrong with novel ecosystems, really?},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {577-582},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The novel ecosystems concept has gained much traction in the restoration
   community. It has also drawn the ire of several prominent ecologists and
   is the focus of an ongoing debate. We consider three key aspects of this
   debate: irreversible thresholds, non-native species, and the hybrid
   state. Irreversible thresholds have been acknowledged in restoration for
   years, but predicting when a threshold will be crossed and the degree of
   reversibility is problematic. Oftentimes reversibility is a function of
   multiple factors, such as cost and public support. In this sense, a
   novel ecosystem is not an alternate state but a decision. The need for
   pragmatism regarding control of non-natives has also long been
   recognized in restoration circles. Proponents of the novel ecosystem
   idea adopt this pragmatism by recommending that management decisions be
   based on impacts conferred by species in altered ecosystems, regardless
   of their origin. The concept of a hybrid state has proven difficult to
   operationalize. We suggest that rather than trying to identify the
   boundary between hybrid and novel states, ecosystems exist on a gradient
   of alteration. We offer a decision tree for restoration action that
   integrates aspects of novel ecosystems with other perspectives in modern
   restoration ecology. We conclude that the idea of novel ecosystems,
   though not perfect, deserves a place under the big tent of restoration
   that includes efforts to return fully to a reference state, as well as
   strategies for reinstating lost ecological processes and enhancing
   ecosystem services in transformed landscapes where such a return is
   deemed infeasible.},

Title = {A comparative framework to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries in
   a global context},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although an ecosystem approach to fisheries has been recognized as a
   means of progressing toward sustainable fishing, successful
   implementation of this approach has been limited. However, one way in
   which progress has been made is through the use of suites of indicators.
   Decision tree frameworks can be used to incorporate trends in
   ecological, fishing, and environmental indicators into ecosystem
   assessments. A relatively generic decision tree framework has been
   developed and successfully applied to multiple ecosystems. This
   framework incorporates trends in indicators, as well as the impacts of
   fishing pressure and environmental variability on ecological indicators
   in order to assess the state of each ecosystem. The inclusion of
   ecosystem expert knowledge from the outset ensures trends are correctly
   interpreted and allows analyses to contribute to global comparisons in a
   robust and meaningful manner. Although ecological and environmental
   indicators are well developed, those addressing the human dimensions of
   marine ecosystems are less so. This framework holds the potential to
   incorporate such indicators in order to fully assess marine ecosystems
   in a comparative context. Such assessments could help ensure food
   security from marine resources into the future as well as ensuring the
   well-being of coastal communities. Here critical review of the potential
   value of this framework has been conducted, with its usefulness
   emphasized in the similarities it holds, and in the contribution it
   could make, to current global methods of ecosystem assessments.},

Title = {Use of support vector machines (SVMs) to predict distribution of an

Abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) methods were used to predict distribution
   pattern of Azolla filiculoides (Lam.) which is an invasive aquatic fern
   at Selkeh Wildlife Refuge located in Anzali wetland (southern Caspian
   Sea, northern Iran). Various structural habitat and physico-chemical
   variables were used as inputs and 3 classes (low, medium and high) of
   cover percentage of Azolla were served as output for the models. SVMs
   were applied using Weka Platt's sequential minimal optimisation (SMO).
   For training and validation of the given method, a 4-fold
   cross-validation was used to get a reliable estimate of model error.
   Some parameter settings in the Weka toolbox were tuned such as the
   effect of the complexity parameter (C) and the degree of the exponent in
   a polynomial kernel. To obtain optimal results in predictive
   performances, the SVMs were optimised based on the application of
   different exponents from one to ten. The model with the best-performing
   exponent was run five times after model randomisation. This was mainly
   done in order to check robustness and reproducibility of SVMs. Model
   quality was assessed using percentage of correctly classified instances
   (CCI \%) and Cohen's kappa statistics (k). The prediction of species
   distribution by SVMs resulted in reliable outcomes (CCI > 77\% and k >
   0.67). SVMs provided quantitative correlations between the distribution
   pattern of this water fern and wetland characteristics. Almost all
   structural habitat variables (except freezing days) played a key role in
   assessing the occurrence of Azolla and were more important than the
   water quality parameters. The depth of wetland and dissolved oxygen were
   the two most important explanatory variables in the study area. SVMs
   hence proved to have a high predictive quality for decision-making in
   wetland conservation and management programmes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Vegetation cover and biodiversity reduce parasite infection in wild
   hosts across ecological levels and scales},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Abstract = {Land use changes and biodiversity loss critically disrupts ecosystem
   functioning and are major drivers of infectious disease outbreaks.
   Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is a multi-host parasite
   whose epidemiology has changed due to the expansion of anthropogenic
   activities over natural areas. We aimed to understand the ecological
   processes increasing parasite prevalence at the individual, the
   community and the landscape levels using the largest database on small
   mammal infection by T. cruzi in Brazil. We applied machine learning
   techniques and structural equation models to show that allometric traits
   and the relative abundance of rodents in the community were important
   predictors of infection risk, followed by variables associated with the
   landscape environmental quality. Natural vegetation cover change and the
   taxonomic and functional dimensions of biodiversity indirectly reduced
   infection through its effect on the abundance distribution and
   composition of host communities. According to our findings, approaches
   to biodiversity conservation and restoration based on the integration of
   social inclusion and human welfare would contribute to regulate the
   prevalence of T. cruzi in wild hosts, which may reduce overall
   transmission risk.},

Title = {Identifying climate thresholds for dominant natural vegetation types at
   the global scale using machine learning: Average climate versus extremes},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {3557-3579},

Abstract = {The global distribution of vegetation is largely determined by climatic
   conditions and feeds back into the climate system. To predict future
   vegetation changes in response to climate change, it is crucial to
   identify and understand key patterns and processes that couple
   vegetation and climate. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) have
   been widely applied to describe the distribution of vegetation types and
   their future dynamics in response to climate change. As a process-based
   approach, it partly relies on hard-coded climate thresholds to constrain
   the distribution of vegetation. What thresholds to implement in DGVMs
   and how to replace them with more process-based descriptions remain
   among the major challenges. In this study, we employ machine learning
   using decision trees to extract large-scale relationships between the
   global distribution of vegetation and climatic characteristics from
   remotely sensed vegetation and climate data. We analyse how the dominant
   vegetation types are linked to climate extremes as compared to
   seasonally or annually averaged climatic conditions. The results show
   that climate extremes allow us to describe the distribution and
   eco-climatological space of the vegetation types more accurately than
   the averaged climate variables, especially those types which occupy
   small territories in a relatively homogeneous ecological space. Future
   predicted vegetation changes using both climate extremes and averaged
   climate variables are less prominent than that predicted by averaged
   climate variables and are in better agreement with those of DGVMs,
   further indicating the importance of climate extremes in determining
   geographic distributions of different vegetation types. We found that
   the temperature thresholds for vegetation types (e.g. grass and open
   shrubland) in cold environments vary with moisture conditions. The
   coldest daily maximum temperature (extreme cold day) is particularly
   important for separating many different vegetation types. These findings
   highlight the need for a more explicit representation of the impacts of
   climate extremes on vegetation in DGVMs.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {Global land degradation and sustainable development has become a serious
   challenge for the terrestrial ecosystems. Shrub plays a crucial role in
   global ecosystem protection, ecological reconstruction, which is
   especially important in arid and semi-arid sandland ecosystem. Shrub
   above ground biomass (AGB) is a proxy of carbon sequestration capacity.
   Shrub AGB in Mu Us Sandland was estimated using different methods based
   on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, topography data, combined with in
   situ survey data. Linear regression model, multiple stepwise regression
   model, machine learning model and geometric optical model were used to
   estimate shrub biomass in combination with in situ data, respectively
   and their effects were validated and compared. Results showed that shrub
   AGB predicted from one multiple stepwise regression model with Ratio
   Vegetation Index (RVI) and Brightness from K-T transformation as input
   variables reached highest accuracy. For both high and low shrub coverage
   regions, shrub AGB distribution maps derived from this multiple stepwise
   regression model achieved higher precision. All these findings will
   provide a scientific support for ecological sustainable development in
   eco-vulnerable ecosystems. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {embarcaderois anrpackage of convenience tools for species distribution
   modelling (SDM) with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), a
   powerful machine learning approach that has been rarely applied to
   ecological problems. Like other classification and regression tree
   methods, BART estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on a
   set of decision trees. Unlike other methods, BART iteratively generates
   sets of trees based on a set of priors about tree structure and nodes,
   and builds a posterior distribution of estimated classification
   probabilities. So far, BARTs have yet to be applied to SDM.
   embarcaderois a workflow wrapper for BART species distribution models,
   and includes functionality for easy spartial prediction, an automated
   variable selection procedure, several types of partial dependence
   visualization and other tools for ecological application.
   Theembarcaderopackage is an open source and available on Github. To show
   howembarcaderocan be used by ecologists, I illustrate a BART workflow
   for a virtual species distribution model. The supplement includes a more
   advanced vignette showing how BART can be used for mapping disease
   transmission risk, using the example of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever

Abstract = {Accurate detection of individual animals is integral to the management
   of vulnerable wildlife species, but often difficult and costly to
   achieve for species that occur over wide or inaccessible areas or engage
   in cryptic behaviours. There is a growing acceptance of the use of
   drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs and remotely
   piloted aircraft systems, RPAS) to detect wildlife, largely because of
   the capacity for drones to rapidly cover large areas compared to ground
   survey methods. While drones can aid the capture of large amounts of
   imagery, detection requires either manual evaluation of the imagery or
   automated detection using machine learning algorithms. While manual
   evaluation of drone-acquired imagery is possible and sometimes
   necessary, the powerful combination of drones with automated detection
   of wildlife in this imagery is much faster and, in some cases, more
   accurate than using human observers. Despite the great potential of this
   emerging approach, most attention to date has been paid to the
   development of algorithms, and little is known about the constraints
   around successful detection (P. W. J. Baxter, and G. Hamilton, 2018,
   Ecosphere, 9, e02194).
   We reviewed studies that were conducted over the last 5 years in which
   wildlife species were detected automatically in drone-acquired imagery
   to understand how technological constraints, environmental conditions
   and ecological traits of target species impact detection with automated
   methods.
   From this review, we found that automated detection could be achieved
   for a wider range of species and under a greater variety of
   environmental conditions than reported in previous reviews of automated
   and manual detection in drone-acquired imagery. A high probability of
   automated detection could be achieved efficiently using fixed-wing
   platforms and RGB sensors for species that were large and occurred in
   open and homogeneous environments with little vegetation or variation in
   topography while infrared sensors and multirotor platforms were
   necessary to successfully detect small, elusive species in complex
   habitats.
   The insight gained in this review could allow conservation managers to
   use drones and machine learning algorithms more accurately and
   efficiently to conduct abundance data on vulnerable populations that is
   critical to their conservation.},

Title = {Using image recognition to automate assessment of cultural ecosystem
   services from social media photographs},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {C, SI},
Pages = {318-325},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Quantifying and mapping cultural ecosystem services is complex because
   of their intangibility. Data from social media, such as geo-tagged
   photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation
   of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of
   large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a
   novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs
   for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online
   machine learning algorithm - Google Cloud Vision - to analyse over
   20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to
   group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed
   by comparison with manual classification. Over 20\% of photographs were
   taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature
   photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and
   nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high
   vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was
   accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method
   provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied
   rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural
   ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Recent advances in drone technology have rapidly led to their use for
   monitoring and managing wildlife populations but a broad and generalised
   framework for their application to complex wildlife aggregations is
   still lacking. We present a generalised semi-automated approach where
   machine learning can map targets of interest in drone imagery, supported
   by predictive modelling for estimating wildlife aggregation populations.
   We demonstrated this application on four large spatially complex
   breeding waterbird colonies on floodplains, ranging from c. 20,000 to c.
   250,000 birds, providing estimates of bird nests. Our mapping and
   modelling approach was applicable to all four colonies, without any
   modification, effectively dealing with variation in nest size, shape,
   colour and density and considerable background variation (vegetation,
   water, sand, soil, etc.). Our semi-automated approach was between three
   and eight times faster than manually counting nests from imagery at the
   same level of accuracy. This approach is a significant improvement for
   monitoring large and complex aggregations of wildlife, offering an
   innovative solution where ground counts are costly, difficult or not
   possible. Our framework requires minimal technical ability, is
   open-source (Google Earth Engine and R), and easy to apply to other
   surveys.},

Title = {The application of game theory-based machine learning modelling to
   assess climate variability effects on the sensitivity of lagoon
   ecosystem parameters},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The extent of changes at the ecosystem level due to external dynamics
   from year to year of meteorological conditions is one of the basic
   determinants of climate change. The object of the study is the
   sensitivity of a set of environmental and planktonic factors shaping the
   ecosystem of a temperate shallow lagoon (the Vistula Lagoon, South
   Baltic) to weather fluctuations from year to year. The specific question
   concerned the short-term advantage of the sequence of environmental
   changes related to the impact of wind or those caused by the air
   temperature. The average speed in the prevailing westerly winds in the
   first summer research season was 3.05 m/s, while in the second it was
   3.84 m/s. Simultaneously, the air temperature changed on average from
   16.8 to 17.3 degrees C. The accuracy of the division of the two-year
   data set of ecosystemic parameters into the first colder and less windy
   and the second, warmer and windier summer was analyzed. For this
   purpose, several machine learning models were used. Next, the model with
   the highest accuracy was selected for the explanatory modelling based on
   game theory metrics Shapley Value. The analysis based on the
   interactions among ecological factors shows that the dynamics of the
   climate on a year-to-year scale can bring significantly more
   environmental changes in the shallow lagoon by an increase in wind speed
   rather than by an increase in air temperature. More windy weather in the
   summer in the subsequent year caused higher wind action, suspended
   solids, silicates and diatoms concentration. Simultaneously, the same
   conditions resulted in lower concentrations of dissolved organic carbon
   and nitrogen forms in water, accompanied by a reduction of Cyanobacteria
   biomass. The procedure presented in the study can be used for
   environmental prognostics of the environmental effects of climate
   change.},

Pages = {305-319},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Hutchinson's n-dimensional hypervolume concept underlies many
   applications in contemporary ecology and evolutionary biology.
   Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge
   due to conceptual and computational issues.
   2. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and
   probability density within n-dimensional hypervolumes. The methods
   produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely
   (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one-classification
   via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept
   abundance-weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a
   probabilistic interpretation and projected into geographic space.
   3. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset
   that characterises the functional traits and geographic distribution of
   thousands of plants. The methods are available in version >= 2.0.7 of
   the HYPERVOLUME R package.
   4. These new algorithms provide: (i) a more robust approach for
   delineating the shape and density of n-dimensional hypervolumes; (ii)
   more efficient performance on large and high-dimensional datasets; and
   (iii) improved measures of functional diversity and environmental niche

Title = {Finding the right fit: Comparative cetacean distribution models using

Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1657-1673},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim: Accurate predictions of cetacean distributions are essential to
   their conservation but are limited by statistical challenges and a
   paucity of data. This study aimed at comparing the capacity of various
   statistical algorithms to deal with biases commonly found in
   nonsystematic cetacean surveys and to evaluate the potential for citizen
   science data to improve habitat modelling and predictions. An endangered
   population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in their breeding
   ground was used as a case study.
   Location: New Caledonia, Oceania.
   Methods: Five statistical algorithms were used to model the habitat
   preferences of humpback whales from 1,360 sightings collected over 14
   years of nonsystematic research surveys. Three different background
   sampling approaches were tested when developing models from 625
   crowdsourced sightings to assess methods accounting for citizen science
   spatial sampling bias. Model evaluation was conducted through
   cross-validation and prediction to an independent satellite tracking
   dataset.
   Results: Algorithms differed in complexity of the environmental
   relationships modelled, ecological interpretability and transferability.
   While parameter tuning had a great effect on model performances, GLMs
   generally had low predictive performance, SVMs were particularly hard to
   interpret, and BRTs had high descriptive power but showed signs of
   overfitting. MAXENT and especially GAMs provided a valuable complexity
   trade-off, accurate predictions and were ecologically intelligible.
   Models showed that humpback whales favoured cool (22-23 degrees C) and
   shallow waters (0-100 m deep) in coastal as well as offshore areas.
   Citizen science models converged with research survey models,
   specifically when accounting for spatial sampling bias.
   Main conclusions: Marine megafauna distribution models present specific
   challenges that may be addressed through integrative evaluation,
   independent testing and appropriately tuned statistical algorithms.
   Specifically, controlling overfitting is a priority when predicting
   cetacean distributions for large-scale conservation perspectives.
   Citizen science data appear to be a powerful tool to describe cetacean
   habitat.},

Title = {Vegetation classification by two new iterative reallocation optimization

Abstract = {This paper presents two new non-hierarchical iterative reallocation
   optimization algorithms for vegetation classification. The OPTimal
   PARTitioning algorithm (OPTPART) optimizes the ratio of within-cluster
   similarity to among-cluster similarity; the OPTimal SILhouette algorithm
   (OPTSIL) optimizes the difference between the similarity of each sample
   to the cluster to which it is assigned and its similarity to the most
   similar cluster. The algorithms were tested on three vegetation datasets
   (Mt. Field Massif, Tazmania, Australia; Podyj/Thayatal National Park,
   Austria/Czech Republic; and Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, USA)
   using three dissimilarity/distance matrices (Bray-Curtis, chord
   distance, and Hellinger distance) and compared to five other commonly
   used or recently introduced vegetation classification algorithms
   (flexible-beta, TWINSPAN, PAM, ISOPAM, and K-means) using eight
   goodness-of-clustering evaluators. Five of the eight evaluators were
   species-based and operate on the distribution of individual taxa among
   clusters; three were community-based and operate on the compositional
   similarity of clusters. OPTPART was initialized from random partitions
   and from the results of a flexible-beta classification as the initial
   partition; OPTSIL was initialized from partitions resulting from
   OPTPART, flexible-beta, and K-means classifications. Algorithms were
   ranked from best to worst on each clustering evaluator for each
   dissimilarity/distance matrix for each dataset, and summarized by median
   ranks. OPTPART, SIL/OPT (OPTSIL from an OPTPART initial partition), and
   SIL/FLEX (OPTSIL from a flexible-beta initial partition) ranked 1-3
   respectively for results pooled across all three datasets and
   dissimilarity/distance matrices. OPTPART, SIL/OPT, and SIL/FLEX
   consistently ranked 1-3 across the individual datasets, although the
   order varied slightly by dataset.},

Title = {How to make ecological models useful for environmental management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {411},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of different
   management alternatives is becoming increasingly important to support
   environmental management decisions. Ecological models could contribute
   to such predictions, but in the past this was often not the case.
   Ecological models are often developed within research projects but are
   rarely used for practical applications. In this synthesis paper, we
   discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting
   environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological
   aspects. We address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users
   of modeling results. Various modeling approaches can be used to predict
   the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions, including
   mechanistic models, statistical models, and machine learning approaches.
   Regardless of the chosen approach, we outline how to better align the
   modeling to the decision making process, and identify six requirements
   that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological
   models for management support, especially if management decisions need
   to be justified to the public. These cover: (i) a mechanistic
   understanding regarding causality, (ii) alignment of model input and
   output with the management decision, (iii) appropriate spatial and
   temporal resolutions, (iv) uncertainty quantification, (v) sufficient
   predictive performance, and (vi) transparent communication. We discuss
   challenges and synthesize suggestions for addressing these points.},

   to support Indigenous cultural revitalization},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Along the Central Coast of California, USA, native plant biodiversity
   has depended on various forms of Indigenous stewardship such as burning,
   tilling, and gathering. Simultaneously, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band (the
   Tribe) depends on these native ecosystems for cultural survivance.
   However, much of the knowledge related to the location and caretaking of
   cultural plants has become dormant in the community due to the immediate
   and ongoing effects of Euro-American colonization. We identified
   potential gathering areas by modeling the spatial distributions of 10
   culturally important plants throughout the Tribe's stewardship area. We
   utilized community science datasets with an ensemble modeling approach
   that combines the results of five machine learning models to predict not
   only the distribution of each species, but also the relative certainty
   of those predictions spatially. Our results revealed that 265.2 km(2)
   (2.1\%) of the Tribe's stewardship area is predicted habitat for seven
   or more of these cultural plants, and that the Tribe has potential
   access to approximately a third of these high-priority areas. Our
   findings will directly inform the Tribe's cultural revitalization and
   ecological stewardship programs. We show how geospatial models can
   support the revitalization of an Indigenous culture by renewing
   relationships with cultural plants.},

Abstract = {Back and forth transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between humans and animals will establish
   wild reservoirs of virus that endanger long-term efforts to control
   COVID-19 in people and to protect vulnerable animal populations. Better
   targeting surveillance and laboratory experiments to validate zoonotic
   potential requires predicting high-risk host species. A major bottleneck
   to this effort is the few species with available sequences for
   angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a key receptor required for
   viral cell entry. We overcome this bottleneck by combining species'
   ecological and biological traits with three-dimensional modelling of
   host-virus protein-protein interactions using machine learning. This
   approach enables predictions about the zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2
   for greater than 5000 mammals-an order of magnitude more species than
   previously possible. Our predictions are strongly corroborated by in
   vivo studies. The predicted zoonotic capacity and proximity to humans
   suggest enhanced transmission risk from several common mammals, and
   priority areas of geographic overlap between these species and global
   COVID-19 hotspots. With molecular data available for only a small
   fraction of potential animal hosts, linking data across biological
   scales offers a conceptual advance that may expand our predictive
   modelling capacity for zoonotic viruses with similarly unknown host
   ranges.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},

Volume = {397},

Abstract = {Large scale inter-basin water diversion projects would have a set of
   ecological and environmental impacts on aquatic ecosystems. However,
   knowledge regarding water transfer induced water quality changes in
   determining fish communities in the impounding ecosystems remain largely
   unknown. In the current study, we filled this research gap by using a
   set of machine learning algorithms to ensemble modelling fish community
   indices with water quality indicators in the impounded lakes along the
   eastern route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP).
   Overall, our results realed that water quality changes can be good
   predictors for the variation of fish community structures in these
   lakes. Although different model techniques highlighted different
   variable importance of water quality in determining fish communities,
   there is generally a consensus that the hydrological related water
   quality indicators like: water clarity (e.g., total suspended solids)
   and nutrient loading (e.g., phosphate) contributed the most to the
   changes of fish communities. Our results also indicated that water
   diversions could bring knock-on effects on fish communities. Thus, more
   attention should be paid to long-term ecological effects from future
   water diversions.},

Title = {Acoustic species identification of shrews: Twittering calls for

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The acoustic signals of shrews (Soricidae) are largely understudied. As
   shrews are very vocal animals it may be feasible to use acoustic methods
   in field studies to assess ecological and behavioral data. In this
   study, we present the first detailed analysis of the twittering calls of
   six Central European shrew species (Sorex minutus, Sorex araneus, Neomys
   fodiens, Neomys anomalus, Crocidura russula and Crocidura leucodon). The
   analysis is based on over 6000 recorded calls from 121 individuals. Our
   results indicate that there is a large inter-individual variance and a
   large inter-specific overlap in the acoustic parameters of the calls.
   Each species uses a large spectral variety of calls without clear
   species specific call types. A species identification using the Support
   Vector Machine method on six species shows 66.2\% accuracy; however, a
   pairwise comparison indicates accuracy between 68.5 and 97.3\%. We
   propose to use acoustic monitoring of shrews in comparative studies to
   estimate the overall shrew activity. Moreover we suggest using the
   acoustic identification method in areas with few shrew species where the
   accuracy of the technique can be eligible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Statistical methods for predicting the spatial abundance of reef fish
   species},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatial distribution of organism abundance is
   fundamental to assessing and managing ecological populations. Marine
   species can be difficult and logistically challenging and expensive to
   observe. This often results in spatial data containing low detection
   rates when sampling underwater, biasing spatial predictions from many
   modeling approaches. We propose a multistage statistical workflow that
   can use zero inflated sampling data to develop non-linear predictive
   spatial distributions of reef fish abundance. The workflow includes: (1)
   an individual-based discrete event simulation which generates simulated
   survey data under different abundance settings; (2) empirical maximum
   likelihood analysis to establish the relationship between survey data
   and abundance from the simulation; (3) a two-step random smoothing
   method to estimate reliable block spatial abundance around each survey
   station; (4) an ensemble of different machine learning models which use
   the estimated abundance from step three as input to compute a stable
   non-linear prediction of abundance across the entire study area (Gulf of
   Mexico). Applying our workflow greatly improved the ability to forecast
   abundance at small spatial scales. The ability to forecast at fine
   spatial scales is critical when working with species that are patchily
   distributed. This workflow can apply to many ecological populations to
   develop abundance maps even if sample data is not well distributed
   across the study area or is zero inflated.},

   Challenges and Future Developments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes, also referred to as Eichhornia
   crassipes) is one of the most invasive weed species in the world,
   causing significant adverse economic and ecological impacts,
   particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Large scale real-time
   monitoring of areas of chronic infestation is critical to formulate
   effective control strategies for this fast spreading weed species.
   Assessment of revenue generation potential of the harvested water
   hyacinth biomass also requires enhanced understanding to estimate the
   biomass yield potential for a given water body. Modern remote sensing
   technologies can greatly enhance our capacity to understand, monitor,
   and estimate water hyacinth infestation within inland as well as coastal
   freshwater bodies. Readily available satellite imagery with high
   spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution, along with conventional and
   modern machine learning techniques for automated image analysis, can
   enable discrimination of water hyacinth infestation from other floating
   or submerged vegetation. Remote sensing can potentially be complemented
   with an array of other technology-based methods, including aerial
   surveys, ground-level sensors, and citizen science, to provide
   comprehensive, timely, and accurate monitoring. This review discusses
   the latest developments in the use of remote sensing and other
   technologies to monitor water hyacinth infestation, and proposes a
   novel, multi-modal approach that combines the strengths of the different
   methods.},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {469-484},

Abstract = {Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems worldwide and are
   frequently described as the kidneys of the earth because of the wide
   range of environmental functions and ecological benefits. Assessments of
   wetland ecosystem health play an important role in the development of
   robust protection and use strategies for wetlands that integrate
   ecological and socio-economic aspects. In this study, the
   Element-Landscape-Society conceptual model for diagnosing wetland
   ecosystem health was constructed. The conceptual model highlights the
   three main elements of wetland ecosystems (i.e. water, soil, and
   vegetation). This study selected eighteen indicators to establish an
   indicator system to diagnose wetland health, considering the importance
   of landscape and social factors. Using remote sensing, field sampling,
   and statistical data, this research constructed models based on the
   analytical hierarchy process and support vector machine methods and
   compared the diagnoses from the two methods and verified them with
   previous studies. Results indicate the indicator system is useful for
   assessing the health of a wetland ecosystem. Overall, the Zoige wetland
   ecosystem had medium health status; the health was good in the center of
   the wetland, but gradually declined towards the edge; therefore, the
   buffer and the experimental area at the edge of the reserve should
   receive more protection.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Vegetation cover is essential to the ecologic and biogeochemical
   functioning of drylands. These systems are marked by spatiotemporal
   variation in vegetation cover and biomass. Regular monitoring of
   vegetation cover in drylands is critical for their conservation and
   management. This study examines the effectiveness of photo-based grid
   point intercept field survey for quantifying vegetation characteristics
   in drylands. The field data provides ground truth data for space borne
   remote sensing to analyze changes in vegetation cover. The study
   integrates rapid field photo sampling, GPS, and GIS to maximize raw data
   collection in the field and allow for subsequent sampling in the
   laboratory setting. Paired T-tests and simple linear regression were
   employed to assess sample size. Quantification of vegetation cover using
   minimum distance (MD), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and support vector
   machine (SVM) automated classification were assessed using visual
   sampling as a reference. Fifty sampling points are sufficient for
   quantifying vegetation cover of steppe, but are less adequate for desert
   steppe. The assessment of automated classifications of photo plots
   revealed that SAM outperformed both MD and SVM. Photo-based Grid-point
   Intercept provides a cost-and time-effective technique for data
   collection to support satellite and air platform remote sensing analysis

Title = {Unmanned aircraft system advances health mapping of fragile polar
   vegetation},

Abstract = {1. Plants like mosses can be sensitive stress markers of subtle shifts
   in Arctic and Antarctic environmental conditions, including climate
   change. Traditional ground-based monitoring of fragile polar vegetation
   is, however, invasive, labour intensive and physically demanding.
   High-resolution multispectral satellite observations are an alternative,
   but even their recent highest achievable spatial resolution is still
   inadequate, resulting in a significant underestimation of plant health
   due to spectral mixing and associated reflectance impurities.
   2. To resolve these obstacles, we have developed a new method that uses
   low-altitude unmanned aircraft system (UAS) hyperspectral images of
   sub-decimeter spatial resolution. Machine-learning support vector
   regressions (SVR) were employed to infer Antarctic moss vigour from
   quantitative remote sensing maps of plant canopy chlorophyll content and
   leaf density. The same maps were derived for comparison purposes from
   the WorldView-2 high spatial resolution (2.2m) multispectral satellite
   data.
   3. We found SVR algorithms to be highly efficient in estimating plant
   health indicators with acceptable root mean square errors (RMSE). The
   systematic RMSEs for chlorophyll content and leaf density were 3.5-6.0
   and 1.3-2.0 times smaller, respectively, than the unsystematic errors.
   However, application of correctly trained SVR machines on space-borne
   multispectral images considerably underestimated moss chlorophyll
   content, while stress indicators retrieved from UAS data were found to
   be comparable with independent field measurements, providing
   statistically significant regression coefficients of determination
   (median r(2)=.50, p(t test)=.0072).
   4. This study demonstrates the superior performance of a cost-efficient
   UAS mapping platform, which can be deployed even under the continuous
   cloud cover that often obscures optical high-altitude airborne and
   satellite observations. Antarctic moss vigour maps of appropriate
   resolution could provide timely and spatially explicit warnings of
   environmental stress events, including those triggered by climate
   change. Since our polar vegetation health assessment method is based on
   physical principles of quantitative spectroscopy, it could be adapted to
   other short-stature and fragmented plant communities (e.g. tundra
   grasslands), including alpine and desert regions. It therefore shows
   potential to become an operational component of any ecological
   monitoring sensor network.},

Title = {Simplifying the selection of evidence synthesis methods to inform
   environmental decisions: A guide for decision makers and scientists},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {213},
Number = {A},
Pages = {135-145},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Achieving evidence-based environmental management requires that
   decision-makers have access to evidence that can help identify the most
   effective interventions for their management context. Evidence synthesis
   supports evidence-based decision-making because it collates, filters and
   makes sense of a sometimes large and often conflicting evidence-base,
   potentially yielding new insights. There are many approaches to evidence
   synthesis. They each have different strengths and weaknesses, making
   them suited to different purposes, questions and contexts, given
   particular constraints. To make sense of the wide array of approaches,
   we outline the important considerations when selecting the most
   appropriate method for a particular decision context. These include the
   purpose for the synthesis, the required outcomes, and the multiple
   constraints within which decision-makers must operate. We then
   critically assess a spectrum of approaches to evidence synthesis
   commonly used within environmental management, detailing the
   characteristics of each that can be used to determine when it is a
   suitable method. To guide this selection process we provide a decision
   tree for those commissioning (e.g., decision-makers or stakeholders) or
   conducting (e.g., scientists) evidence synthesis, which can be used to
   identify an appropriate method. The decision tree classifies evidence
   synthesis methods according to whether their purpose is to test or
   generate hypotheses, the level of resources they require, the level of
   certainty in the outputs, and the type and scope of the question being
   addressed. This tool is a major advance because it helps select an
   appropriate synthesis method based on the multiple constraints that
   impact the decision. We conclude that there is an approach to evidence
   synthesis that will suit all management contexts, but that selecting the
   right approach requires careful consideration of what is fit for
   purpose.},

Title = {Identifying Movement States From Location Data Using Cluster Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {588-594},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Animal movement studies regularly use movement states (e. g., slow and
   fast) derived from remotely sensed locations to make inferences about
   strategies of resource use. However, the number of movement state
   categories used is often arbitrary and rarely inferred from the data.
   Identifying groups with similar movement characteristics is a
   statistical problem. We present a framework based on k-means clustering
   and gap statistic for evaluating the number of movement states without
   making a priori assumptions about the number of clusters. This allowed
   us to distinguish 4 movement states using turning angle and step length
   derived from Global Positioning System locations and head movements
   derived from tip switches in a neck collar of free-ranging elk (Cervus
   elaphus) in west central Alberta, Canada. Based on movement
   characteristics and on the linkage between each state and landscape
   features, we were able to identify inter-patch movements, intra-patch
   foraging, rest, and inter-patch foraging movements. Linking behavior to
   environment (e. g., state-dependent habitat use) can inform decisions on
   landscape management for wildlife.},

Title = {Improving area of occupancy estimates for parapatric species using
   distribution models and support vector machines},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As geographic range estimates for the IUCN Red List guide conservation
   actions, accuracy and ecological realism are crucial. IUCN's extent of
   occurrence (EOO) is the general region including the species' range,
   while area of occupancy (AOO) is the subset of EOO occupied by the
   species. Data-poor species with incomplete sampling present particular
   difficulties, but species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to
   predict suitable areas. Nevertheless, SDMs typically employ abiotic
   variables (i.e., climate) and do not explicitly account for biotic
   interactions that can impose range constraints. We sought to improve
   range estimates for data-poor, parapatric species by masking out areas
   under inferred competitive exclusion. We did so for two South American
   spiny pocket mice: Heteromys australis (Least Concern) and Heteromys
   teleus (Vulnerable due to especially poor sampling), whose ranges appear
   restricted by competition. For both species, we estimated EOO using SDMs
   and AOO with four approaches: occupied grid cells, abiotic SDM
   prediction, and this prediction masked by approximations of the areas
   occupied by each species' congener. We made the masks using support
   vector machines (SVMs) fit with two data types: occurrence coordinates
   alone; and coordinates along with SDM predictions of suitability. Given
   the uncertainty in calculating AOO for low-data species, we made
   estimates for the lower and upper bounds for AOO, but only make
   recommendations for H. teleus as its full known range was considered.
   The SVM approaches (especially the second one) had lower classification
   error and made more ecologically realistic delineations of the contact
   zone. For H. teleus, the lower AOO bound (a strongly biased
   underestimate) corresponded to Endangered (occupied grid cells), while
   the upper bounds (other approaches) led to Near Threatened. As we
   currently lack data to determine the species' true occupancy within the
   post-processed SDM prediction, we recommend that an updated listing for
   H. teleus include these bounds for AOO. This study advances methods for
   estimating the upper bound of AOO and highlights the need for better
   ways to produce unbiased estimates of lower bounds. More generally, the
   SVM approaches for post-processing SDM predictions hold promise for
   improving range estimates for other uses in biogeography and
   conservation.},

Title = {PREDICTIVE HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELLING OF AXIS PORCINUS (HOG DEER)
   UNDER CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS IN PUNJAB, PAKISTAN},

Abstract = {It is anticipated that climate change will cause biodiversity loss by
   altering natural habitats and species distribution. The main purpose of
   the study was to model the current and future distribution of Axis
   porcinus to predict the changes in their habitat in Punjab, Pakistan. A
   Total of 32 variables including bioclimatic, natural, topographical and
   human impact variables were prepared. Dimension reduction was done by
   three methods, namely the Pearson's correlation, multi-collinearity
   analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve the
   appropriate number of predictors. The study predicted the potential
   distribution of species by the 2050s and 2070s under representative
   concentrative pathways (RCPs) RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change
   scenarios using earth observations and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) machine
   learning model. Results revealed that highly suitable areas for current
   distribution of Axis porcinus cover 451.3 Km(2). According to future
   projections suitable habitat will face an 18.7\% decline by 2050s
   according to RCP 4.5 scenario or 52.8\% based on the RCP 8.5 scenario
   which is alarming and protection measures are crucial. Based on the
   current and future distribution of the species, three priority
   conservation areas covering 632 Km(2) for Axis porcinus are identified.
   This study supports the formulation of current conservation policies and
   strategies for protection of the species keeping in view the impact of

Title = {An Ecological Expert System Optimization for Assessing Environmental
   Water Requirements of Hypersaline Lakes},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The present study proposes an applicable methodology to optimize
   environmental water requirement of hypersaline lakes with a focus on
   Urmia lake as the case study in which remote sensing analysis, machine
   learning model and fuzzy expert system are linked. A machine learning
   model was developed to simulate effective abiotic parameters in which
   bands of operational land imager (Landsat 8) were inputs and depth and
   total dissolved solids were the outputs of the model. Moreover, an
   ecological expert system using Mamadani fuzzy inference system was
   developed to generate the habitat suitability map for the selected
   target species. Then, a multivariate linear model was developed to
   assess unit habitat suitability in which water level and total inflow of
   the lake were the variables of the model. An optimization model was
   developed to assess environmental water requirement in which habitat
   suitability between natural and regulated flows and water supply loss
   was minimized. The multivariate linear model was applied to assess
   habitat suitability in the optimization model. Based on the results in
   the case study, the proposed combined model is able to balance the
   ecological requirements and water demand by allocating 60\% and 40\% of
   total inflow to environmental water requirement and water demand
   respectively. Average habitat loss proposed by the optimal environmental
   water requirement was less than 20\% which implies the robustness of the
   model. Generating habitat suitability maps of the lake by a reliable
   method which is used in the environmental flow optimization might be the
   significance of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Historically, marine ecologists have lacked efficient tools that are
   capable of capturing detailed species distribution data over large
   areas. Emerging technologies such as high-resolution imaging and
   associated machine-learning image-scoring software are providing new
   tools to map species over large areas in the ocean. Here, we combine a
   novel diver propulsion vehicle (DPV) imaging system with free-to-use
   machine-learning software to semi-automatically generate dense and
   widespread abundance records of a habitat-forming algae over similar to
   5,000 m(2) of temperate reef. We employ replicable spatial techniques to
   test the effectiveness of traditional diver-based sampling, and better
   understand the distribution and spatial arrangement of one key algal
   species. We found that the effectiveness of a traditional survey
   depended on the level of spatial structuring, and generally 10-20
   transects (50 x 1 m) were required to obtain reliable results. This
   represents 2-20 times greater replication than have been collected in
   previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of
   fine-resolution distribution modeling for understanding patterns in
   canopy algae cover at multiple spatial scales, and discuss applications
   to other marine habitats. Our analyses demonstrate that semi-automated
   methods of data gathering and processing provide more accurate results
   than traditional methods for describing habitat structure at seascape
   scales, and therefore represent vastly improved techniques for
   understanding and managing marine seascapes.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Information on landscape-scale patterns in species distributions and
   community types is vital for ecological science and effective
   conservation assessment and planning. However, detailed maps of plant
   community structure at landscape scales seldom exist due to the
   inability of field-based inventories to map a sufficient number of
   individuals over large areas. The Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO)
   collected hyperspectral and lidar data over Kruger National Park, South
   Africa, and these data were used to remotely identify >500000 tree and
   shrub crowns over a 144-km(2) landscape using stacked support vector
   machines. Maps of community compositional variation were produced by
   ordination and clustering, and the importance of hillslope-scale
   topo-edaphic variation in shaping community structure was evaluated with
   redundancy analysis. This remote species identification approach
   revealed spatially complex patterns in woody plant communities
   throughout the landscape that could not be directly observed using
   field-based methods alone. We estimated that topo-edaphic variables
   representing catenal sequences explained 21\% of species compositional
   variation, while we also uncovered important community patterns that
   were unrelated to catenas, indicating a large role for other
   soil-related factors in shaping the savanna community. Our results
   demonstrate the ability of airborne species identification techniques to
   map biodiversity for the evaluation of ecological controls on community
   composition over large landscapes.},

Abstract = {There has been a recent explosion in development of image recognition
   technology and its application to automated plant identification, so it
   is timely to consider its potential for field botany. Nine free apps or

   disparate set of 38 images of plants or parts of plants chosen from the
   higher plant flora of Britain and Ireland. There were large differences
   in performance with the best apps identifying >50 \% of samples tested
   to genus or better. Although the accuracy is good for some of the
   top-rated apps, for any quantitative biodiversity study or for
   ecological surveys, there remains a need for validation by experts or
   against conventional floras. Nevertheless, the better-performing apps
   should be of great value to beginners and amateurs and may usefully

Title = {Monitoring the ecological status of rivers with diatom eDNA
   metabarcoding: A comparison of taxonomic markers and analytical
   approaches for the inference of a molecular diatom index},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {2959-2968},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recently, several studies demonstrated the usefulness of diatom eDNA
   metabarcoding as an alternative to assess the ecological quality of
   rivers and streams. However, the choice of the taxonomic marker as well
   as the methodology for data analysis differ between these studies,
   hampering the comparison of their results and effectiveness. The aim of
   this study was to compare two taxonomic markers commonly used in diatom
   metabarcoding and three distinct analytical approaches to infer a
   molecular diatom index. We used the values of classical morphological
   diatom index as a benchmark for this comparison. We amplified and
   sequenced both a fragment of the rbcL gene and the V4 region of the 18S
   rRNA gene for 112 epilithic samples from Swiss and French rivers. We
   inferred index values using three analytical approaches: by computing it
   directly from taxonomically assigned sequences, by calibrating de novo
   the ecovalues of all metabarcodes, and by using a supervised machine
   learning algorithm to train predictive models. In general, the values of
   index obtained using the two ``taxonomy-free{''} approaches,
   encompassing molecular assignment and machine learning, were closer
   correlated to the values of the morphological index than the values
   based on taxonomically assigned sequences. The correlations of the three
   analytical approaches were higher in the case of rbcL compared to the
   18S marker, highlighting the importance of the reference database which
   is more complete for the rbcL marker. Our study confirms the
   effectiveness of diatom metabarcoding as an operational tool for rivers
   ecological quality assessment and shows that the analytical approaches
   by-passing the taxonomic assignments are particularly efficient when
   reference databases are incomplete.},

Title = {Bacterioplankton composition as an indicator of environmental status:
   proof of principle using indicator value analysis of estuarine
   communities},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Increasing awareness of environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic
   activities highlights the need to determine indicators of environmental
   status that can be routinely assessed at large spatial and temporal
   scales. Microbial communities comprise the greatest share of biological
   diversity on Earth and can rapidly reflect recent environmental changes
   while providing a record of past events. However, they have rarely been
   targeted in the search for ecological indicators of habitat types,
   environmental conditions, or environmental changes. Here, as a proof of
   principle, we analysed the bacterioplankton community composition of 4
   estuaries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, and looked for
   indicators of groups of samples defined using partition techniques,
   according to primary physicochemical variables typically monitored to
   infer water quality. Indicator value analysis (IndVal) was conducted to
   identify indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs; analogous to
   species in other fields of ecology) in each group. These
   bacterioplankton-based indicators exhibited a high capacity to predict
   the group membership of the samples within each estuary and to correctly
   assign the samples to the appropriate estuary in a combined data set,
   employing different machine learning techniques. The indicators were
   composed of OTUs belonging to several bacterial phyla, which responded
   significantly and differentially to the environmental variables used to
   define the groups of samples. Moreover, the predictive values of these
   bacterial indicators were generally higher than those of other
   biological assemblages commonly used for environmental monitoring.
   Therefore, this approach appears to be a promising tool to complement
   existing strategies for monitoring and conservation of aquatic systems
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {What makes a species able to colonize novel environments? This question
   is key to understand the dynamics of adaptive radiations and ecological
   niche shifts, but the mechanisms that underlie expansion into novel
   habitats remain poorly understood at a genomic scale. Lizards from the
   genus Anolis are typically tropical, and the green anole (Anolis
   carolinensis) constitutes an exception since it expanded into temperate
   North America from subtropical Florida. Thus, we used the green anole as
   a model to investigate signatures of selection associated with
   colonization of a new environment, namely temperate North America. To
   this end, we analysed 29 whole-genome sequences, covering the entire
   native range of the species. We used a combination of recent methods to
   quantify both positive and balancing selection in northern populations,
   including F-ST outlier methods, machine learning and ancestral
   recombination graphs. We naively scanned for genes of interest and
   assessed the overlap between multiple tests. Strikingly, we identified
   many genes involved in behaviour, suggesting that the recent successful
   colonization of northern environments may have been linked to
   behavioural shifts as well as physiological adaptation. Using a
   candidate genes strategy, we determined that genes involved in response
   to cold or behaviour displayed more frequently signals of selection,
   while controlling for local recombination rate, gene clustering and gene
   length. In addition, we found signatures of balancing selection at
   immune genes in all investigated genetic groups, but also at genes
   involved in neuronal and anatomical development.},

Abstract = {Incursions of the Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Qfly) into
   areas without permanent Qfly populations present serious threats to the
   Australian and New Zealand horticultural industries. Identifying the
   origins of recent incursions will help reduce future threats by enabling
   the targeting of problematic incursion routes for more stringent
   quarantine protocols. Here we present an analytical framework based on
   supervised and unsupervised machine learning to identify the origins and
   recent population history of incursion individuals. Our framework is
   based on a recently developed reference dataset of genome-wide markers
   for 35 Qfly populations from across the ranges of Qfly and the related
   taxon Bactrocera aquilonis (NTfly). We apply our framework to recent
   incursions into New Zealand, Tasmania and South Australia. Two distinct
   Qfly sources were identified for incursions into New Zealand (total 18
   individuals), one from the east coast of Australia and one from New
   Caledonia. All eight recent incursion collections analysed (total 85
   individuals) from South Australia and Tasmania most likely originated
   from just one of six clusters of populations in our reference database,
   Qfly from the east coast of Australia. None were found to originate from
   clusters containing NTfly or Qfly/NTfly hybrids in the Northern
   Territory or north Western Australia. Several, but not all, of the
   collections showed signals of small founding population size and two
   Tasmanian collections each included individuals apparently derived from
   three different sources within the east coast of Australia. In total,
   several more incursion events were detected than previously known,
   although some were founded by relatively few individuals.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen an exponential increase in the amount of data
   available in all sciences and application domains. Macroecology is part
   of this ``Big Data{''} trend, with a strong rise in the volume of data
   that we are using for our research. Here, we summarize the most recent
   developments in macroecology in the age of Big Data that were presented
   at the 2018 annual meeting of the Specialist Group Macroecology of the
   Ecological Society of Germany, Austria and Switzerland (Gfo). Supported
   by computational advances, macroecology has been a rapidly developing
   field over recent years. Our meeting highlighted important avenues for
   further progress in terms of standardized data collection, data
   integration, method development and process integration. In particular,
   we focus on (a) important data gaps and new initiatives to close them,
   for example through space- and airborne sensors, (b) how various data
   sources and types can be integrated, (c) how uncertainty can be assessed
   in data-driven analyses and (d) how Big Data and machine learning
   approaches have opened new ways of investigating processes rather than
   simply describing patterns. We discuss how Big Data opens up new
   opportunities, but also poses new challenges to macroecological
   research. In the future, it will be essential to carefully assess data
   quality, the reproducibility of data compilation and analytical methods,
   and the communication of uncertainties. Major progress in the field will
   depend on the definition of data standards and workflows for
   macroecology, such that scientific quality and integrity are guaranteed,
   and collaboration in research projects is made easier.},

Abstract = {Animal signals evolve in an ecological context. Locally adapting animal
   sexual signals can be especially important for initiating or reinforcing
   reproductive isolation during the early stages of speciation. Previous
   studies have demonstrated that dewlap colour in Anolis lizards can be
   highly variable between populations in relation to both biotic and
   abiotic adaptive drivers at relatively large geographical scales. Here,
   we investigated differentiation of dewlap coloration among habitat types
   at a small spatial scale, within multiple islands of the West Indies, to
   test the hypothesis that similar local adaptive processes occur over
   smaller spatial scales. We explored variation in dewlap coloration in
   the most widespread species of anole, Anolis sagrei, across three
   characteristic habitats spanning the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands,
   namely beach scrub, primary coppice forest and mangrove forest. Using
   reflectance spectrometry paired with supervised machine learning, we
   found significant differences in spectral properties of the dewlap
   between habitats within small islands, sometimes over very short
   distances. Passive divergence in dewlap phenotype associated with
   isolation-by-distance did not seem to explain our results. On the other
   hand, these habitat-specific dewlap differences varied in magnitude and
   direction across islands, and thus, our primary test for
   adaptation-parallel responses across islands-was not supported. We
   suggest that neutral processes or selection could be involved in several
   ways, including sexual selection. Our results shed new light on the
   scale at which signal colour polymorphism can be maintained in the
   presence of gene flow, and the relative role of local adaptation and
   other processes in driving these patterns of dewlap colour variation
   across islands.},

Title = {Global maps of lake surface water temperatures reveal pitfalls of
   air-for-water substitutions in ecological prediction},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In modeling species distributions and population dynamics,
   spatially-interpolated climatic data are often used as proxies for real,
   on-the-ground measurements. For shallow freshwater systems, this
   practice may be problematic as interpolations used for surface waters
   are generated from terrestrial sensor networks measuring air
   temperatures. Using these may therefore bias statistical estimates of
   species' environmental tolerances or population projections -
   particularly among pleustonic and epilimnetic organisms. Using a global
   database of millions of daily satellite-derived lake surface water
   temperatures (LSWT), I trained machine learning models to correct for
   the correspondence between air and LSWT as a function of atmospheric and
   topographic predictors, resulting in the creation of monthly
   high-resolution global maps of air-LSWT offsets, corresponding
   uncertainty measures and derived LSWT-based bioclimatic layers for use
   by the scientific community. I then compared the performance of these
   LSWT layers and air temperature-based layers in population dynamic and
   ecological niche models (ENM). While generally high, the correspondence
   between air temperature and LSWT was quite variable and often nonlinear
   depending on the spatial context. These LSWT predictions were better
   able to capture the modeled population dynamics and geographic
   distributions of two common aquatic plant species. Further, ENM models
   trained with LSWT predictors more accurately captured lab-measured
   thermal response curves. I conclude that these predicted LSWT
   temperatures perform better than raw air temperatures when used for
   population projections and environmental niche modeling, and should be
   used by practitioners to derive more biologically-meaningful results.
   These global LSWT predictions and corresponding error estimates and
   bioclimatic layers have been made freely available to all researchers in
   a permanent archive.},

Title = {Nonlinear higher order abiotic interactions explain riverine
   biodiversity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {628-639},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aim: Theory and experiments strongly support the importance of
   interactive effects of multiple factors shaping biodiversity, although
   their importance rarely has been investigated at biogeographically
   relevant scales. In particular, the importance of higher order
   interactions among environmental factors at such scales is largely
   unknown. We investigated higher order interactions of environmental
   factors to explain diversity patterns in a metacommunity of aquatic
   invertebrates at a biogeographically relevant scale and discuss the
   findings in an environmental management context.
   Location: All major drainage basins in Switzerland (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino
   and Inn; 41,285km(2)).
   Methods: Riverine -diversity patterns at two taxonomic levels (family
   richness of all benthic macroinvertebrates and species richness of
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were examined at 518 sites
   across the basins. We applied a novel machine learning technique to
   detect key three-way interactions of explanatory variables by comparing
   the relative importance of 1,140 three-way combinations for family
   richness and 680 three-way combinations for species richness.
   Results: Relatively few but important three-way interactions were
   meaningful for predicting biodiversity patterns among the numerous
   possible combinations. Specifically, we found that interactions among
   elevational gradient, prevalence of forest coverage in the upstream
   basin and biogeoclimatic regional classification were distinctly
   important.
   Main conclusion: Our results indicated that a high prevalence of
   terrestrial forest generally sustains riverine benthic macroinvertebrate
   diversity, but this relationship varies considerably with biogeoclimatic
   and elevational conditions likely due to community composition of
   forests and macroinvertebrates changing along climatic and geographical
   gradients. An adequate management of riverine ecosystems at relevant
   biogeographical scales requires the identification of such interactions
   and a context-dependent implementation.},

Title = {A comparison of machine learning and statistical species distribution
   models: Quantifying overfitting supports model interpretation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {481},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Species distribution models are commonly applied to predict species
   responses to environmental conditions. A wide variety of models with
   different properties exist that vary in complexity, which affects their
   predictive performance and interpretability. Machine learning algorithms
   are increasingly used because they are capable to capture complex
   relationships and are often better in prediction. However, to inform
   environmental manage-ment, it is important that a model predicts well
   for the right reasons. It remains a challenge to select a model with a
   reasonable level of complexity that captures the true relationship
   between the response and explanatory variables as good as possible
   rather than fitting to the noise in the data.In this study we ask: 1)
   how much predictive performance can we gain by using increasingly
   complex models, 2) how does model complexity affect the degree of
   overfitting, and 3) do the inferred responses differ among models and
   what can we learn from them? To address these questions, we applied
   eight models with different complexity to predict the probability of
   occurrence of freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa based on 2729 Swiss
   monitoring samples. We compared the models in terms of predictive
   performance during cross-validation and for generalization out of the
   calibration domain ({''}extrapolation{''} or transferability). We
   applied model agnostic tools to shed light on model
   interpretability.Contrary to our expectation, all models predicted
   similarly well during cross-validation, while no model predicted better
   than the null model during out-of-domain generalization on average over
   all taxa. Performance was best for taxa with intermediate prevalence.
   More complex models predicted slightly better than standard statistical
   models but were prone to overfitting.Overfitting indicates that a model
   describes not only the signal in the data but also part of the noise.
   This impedes the interpretation of response shapes learned by the model,
   because one cannot distinguish the signal from the noise. Furthermore,
   the strongly overfitting models learned irregular relationships and
   strong in-teractions that are ecologically not plausible. Thus, in this
   study, the minor gain in predictive performance from more complex models
   was outweighed by the overfitting.Ecological field data that is used as
   model input or for calibration is typically prone to different sources
   of variability, from sampling, the measurement process and
   stochasticity. We therefore call for caution when using complex
   data-driven models to learn about species responses or to inform
   environmental management. In such cases, we recommend to compare a range
   of models regarding their predictive performance, overfitting and
   response shapes to better understand the robustness of inferred
   responses.},

Title = {Opportunities for improved distribution modelling practice via a strict
   maximum likelihood interpretation of MaxEnt},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {172-183},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling, as implemented in the Maxent
   software, has rapidly become one of the most popular methods for
   distribution modelling. Originally, MaxEnt was described as a
   machine-learning method. More recently, it has been explained from
   principles of Bayesian estimation. MaxEnt offers numerous options
   (variants of the method) and settings (tuning of parameters) to the
   users. A widespread practice of accepting the Maxent software's default
   options and settings has been established, most likely because of
   ecologists' lack of familiarity with machine-learning and Bayesian
   statistical concepts and the ease by which the default models are
   obtained in Maxent. However, these defaults have been shown, in many
   cases, to be suboptimal and exploration of alternatives has repeatedly
   been called for. In this paper, we derive MaxEnt from strict maximum
   likelihood principles, and point out parallels between MaxEnt and
   standard modelling tools like generalised linear models (GLM).
   Furthermore, we describe several new options opened by this new
   derivation of MaxEnt, which may improve MaxEnt practice. The most
   important of these is the option for selecting variables by subset
   selection methods instead of the (1)-regularisation method, which
   currently is the Maxent software default. Other new options include:
   incorporation of new transformations of explanatory variables and user
   control of the transformation process; improved variable contribution
   measures and options for variation partitioning; and improved output
   prediction formats. The new options are exemplified for a data set for
   the plant species Scorzonera humilis in SE Norway, which was analysed by
   the standard MaxEnt procedure in a previously published paper. We
   recommend that thorough comparisons between the proposed alternative
   options and default procedures and variants thereof be carried out.},

Title = {Bagging GLM: Improved generalized linear model for the analysis of
   zero-inflated data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Pages = {270-275},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Species-occurrence data sets tend to contain a large proportion of zero
   values, i.e., absence values (zero-inflated). Statistical inference
   using such data sets is likely to be inefficient or lead to incorrect
   conclusions unless the data are treated carefully. In this study, we
   propose a new modeling method to overcome the problems caused by
   zero-inflated data sets that involves a regression model and a
   machine-learning technique. We combined a generalized liner model (GLM).
   which is widely used in ecology, and bootstrap aggregation (bagging), a
   machine-learning technique. We established distribution models of
   Vincetoxicum pycnostelma (a vascular plant) and Ninox scutulata (an
   owl), both of which are endangered and have zero-inflated distribution
   patterns, using our new method and traditional GLM and compared model
   performances. At the same time we modeled four theoretical data sets
   that contained different ratios of presence/absence values using new and
   traditional methods and also compared model performances. For
   distribution models, our new method showed good performance compared to
   traditional GLMs. After bagging, area under the curve (AUC) values were
   almost the same as with traditional methods, but sensitivity values were
   higher. Additionally, our new method showed high sensitivity values
   compared to the traditional GLM when modeling a theoretical data set
   containing a large proportion of zero values. These results indicate
   that our new method has high predictive ability with presence data when
   analyzing zero-inflated data sets. Generally, predicting presence data
   is more difficult than predicting absence data. Our new modeling method
   has potential for advancing species distribution modeling. (C) 2011

Title = {Environment, vector, or host? Using machine learning to untangle the
   mechanisms driving arbovirus outbreaks},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climatic, landscape, and host features are critical components in
   shaping outbreaks of vector-borne diseases. However, the relationship
   between the outbreaks of vector-borne pathogens and their environmental
   drivers is typically complicated, nonlinear, and may vary by taxonomic
   units below the species level (e.g., strain or serotype). Here, we aim
   to untangle how these complex forces shape the risk of outbreaks of
   Bluetongue virus (BTV); a vector-borne pathogen that is continuously
   emerging and re-emerging across Europe, with severe economic
   implications. We tested if the ecological predictors of BTV outbreak
   risk were serotype-specific by examining the most prevalent serotypes
   recorded in Europe (1, 4, and 8). We used a robust machine learning (ML)
   pipeline and 23 relevant environmental features to fit predictive models
   to 24,245 outbreaks reported in 25 European countries between 2000 and
   2019. Our ML models demonstrated high predictive performance for all BTV
   serotypes (accuracies > 0.87) and revealed strong nonlinear
   relationships between BTV outbreak risk and environmental and host
   features. Serotype-specific analysis suggests, however, that each of the
   major serotypes (1, 4, and 8) had a unique outbreak risk profile. For
   example, temperature and midge abundance were as the most important
   characteristics shaping serotype 1, whereas for serotype 4 goat density
   and temperature were more important. We were also able to identify
   strong interactive effects between environmental and host
   characteristics that were also serotype specific. Our ML pipeline was
   able to reveal more in-depth insights into the complex epidemiology of
   BTVs and can guide policymakers in intervention strategies to help
   reduce the economic implications and social cost of this important
   pathogen.},

Title = {Inferring species interaction networks from species abundance data: A
   comparative evaluation of various statistical and machine learning
   methods},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The complexity of ecosystems is staggering, with hundreds or thousands
   of species interacting in a number of ways from competition and
   predation to facilitation and mutualism. Understanding the networks that
   form the systems is of growing importance, e.g. to understand how
   species will respond to climate change, or to predict potential knock-on
   effects of a biological control agent. In recent years, a variety of
   summary statistics for characterising the global and local properties of
   such networks have been derived, which provide a measure for gauging the
   accuracy of a mathematical model for network formation processes.
   However, the critical underlying assumption is that the true network is
   known. This is not a straightforward task to accomplish, and typically
   requires minute observations and detailed field work. More importantly,
   knowledge about species interactions is restricted to specific kinds of
   interactions. For instance, while the interactions between pollinators
   and their host plants are amenable to direct observation, other types of
   species interactions, like those mentioned above, are not, and might not
   even be clearly defined from the outset. To discover information about
   complex ecological systems efficiently, new tools for inferring the
   structure of networks from field data are needed. In the present study,
   we investigate the viability of various statistical and machine learning
   methods recently applied in molecular systems biology: graphical
   Gaussian models, L1-regularised regression with least absolute shrinkage
   and selection operator (LASSO), sparse Bayesian regression and Bayesian
   networks. We have assessed the performance of these methods on data
   simulated from food webs of known structure, where we combined a niche
   model with a stochastic population model in a 2-dimensional lattice. We
   assessed the network reconstruction accuracy in terms of the area under
   the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was typically
   in the range between 0.75 and 0.9, corresponding to the recovery of
   about 60\% of the true species interactions at a false prediction rate
   of 5\%. We also applied the models to presence/absence data for 39
   European warblers, and found that the inferred species interactions
   showed a weak yet significant correlation with phylogenetic similarity
   scores, which tended to weakly increase when including bio-climate
   covariates and allowing for spatial autocorrelation. Our findings
   demonstrate that relevant patterns in ecological networks can be
   identified from large-scale spatial data sets with machine learning
   methods, and that these methods have the potential to contribute novel
   important tools for gaining deeper insight into the structure and
   stability of ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Case-based predictions for species and habitat mapping},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {177},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {259-281},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The specific feature of case-based predictions is the presence of
   empirical data within a predicting system. Case-based methods are
   especially well suited to situations where a single class is represented
   by more than one cluster, or a class fills an irregular shape in the
   feature space. Case-based ecological mapping relies on the assumption of
   finding a species (or other phenomenon) in locations similar to those
   where this species has already been registered. Lazy learning is a
   machine learning approach for fitting case-based prediction systems,
   which prefers raw data to generalizations. An overview of lazy learning
   methods: feature selection and weighting, fitting the number of
   exemplars or kernel extent used for decisions, indexing the case-base,
   learning new and forgetting useless exemplars, and exemplar weighting,
   is given. A case study of habitat and forest composition mapping was
   accomplished in Otepaa Upland in South-East Estonia. Habitat classes
   were predicted and mapped on the whole study area; five characteristics
   of stand composition, presence/absence of Quercus robur, total coverage
   of forest stand, coverage of coniferous trees, and eight main tree
   species separately, were mapped on non-agricultural and non-settlement
   areas. The explanatory variables were derived from: Landsat 7 ETM image,
   greyscale and colour orthophotos, elevation model, 1:10 000 digital base
   map, and soil map. One thousand random locations were described in the
   field in order to obtain training data. Four methods of machine learning
   were compared. In calculations of similarity, exemplar and feature
   weights regulated both the influence of particular exemplars and
   features, and kernel extent. Goodness-of-fit of predictions was
   estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation. A machine learning
   method combining stepwise feature selection, feature weighting, and
   exemplar weighting reached the best results in the case of 10 response
   variables. A method involving iterative random sampling proved to be the
   best for the other seven variables. The best fit was found for
   variables: habitat class (kappa = 0.85), oak presence/absence (mean true
   positive + mean true negative - 1 = 0.72), coverage of coniferous trees
   (R-2 = 0.80), coverage of Pinus sylvestris (R-2 = 0.72), and coverage of
   Picea abies (R-2 = 0.73). In most cases, less than a half of training
   instances were retained as exemplars after case filtering, and less than
   half of the explanatory variables were used in predictive sets. All 31
   explanatory variables were included in a predictive set of features at
   least once. The most valuable predictor was land cover category
   according to the 1:10,000 base map. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation has several phases; thus, the ecological
   significance of each phase during a particular period of time must be
   interpreted. To interpret, this study quantifies the magnitude of forest
   loss and the changes in the temporal pattern of fragmentation in the
   State of Selangor, peninsular Malaysia. Using the decision tree model of
   land transformation, five phases of forest fragmentation were
   identified: perforation, dissection, dissipation, shrinkage and
   attrition. This analysis showed that the magnitude of forest loss was
   the highest during the dissipation phase. The patchiness analysis showed
   that dissipation contributes to the highest environmental uncertainty
   found for the forest patches. This study can be considered a first step
   in the exploration of the properties and the behavioural pattern shown
   by the spatial process of forest fragmentation.},

Title = {Dynamic monitoring of wetland cover changes using time-series remote
   sensing imagery},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Time-series remote sensing data, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data hold considerable promise for
   investigating long-term dynamics of land use/cover change (LUCC), given
   their significant advantages of frequent temporal coverage and free
   cost. However, because of the complex ecological environment of
   wetlands, the applicability of these data for studying temporal dynamics
   of wetland-related land-cover types is limited. This is especially so
   for the Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, which has active
   seasonal and inter-annual dynamics. The primary objective of this study
   is to investigate the suitability of MODIS 250-m maximum value composite
   (MVC) vegetation indexes (VIs) for dynamics monitoring of the Poyang
   Lake. We applied a time-series 16-day MODIS NDVI from 2000 to 2012 and
   developed a method to classify wetland cover types based on timing of
   inundation. We combined techniques of applying iterative self-organizing
   data analysis (ISODATA) with varying numbers of clusters and a
   transformed divergence (TD) statistic, to implement annual
   classification of smoothed time-series NDVI. In addition, we propose a
   decision tree based on features derived from NDVI profiles, to
   characterize phenological differences among clusters. Supported by
   randomly generated validation samples from TM images and daily water
   level records, we obtained a satisfactory accuracy assessment report.
   Classification results showed various change patterns for four dominant
   land cover types. Water area showed a non-significant declining trend
   with average annual change rate 33.25 km(2), indicating a drier Poyang
   lake, and emergent vegetation area had weak change over the past 13
   years. Areas of submerged vegetation and mudflat expanded, with
   significant average annual change rate 23.51 km(2) for the former. The
   results suggest that MODIS' 250-m spatial resolution is appropriate and
   the classification method based on timing of inundation is useful for
   mapping general land cover patterns of Poyang Lake. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Identification of optimal water transfer schemes for restoration of a
   eutrophic lake: An integrated simulation-optimization method},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {409-421},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This research developed an integrated simulation-optimization method
   (ISOM). This model incorporated eutrophication modeling, water resource
   allocation and trophic status assessment within a general modeling
   framework. In ISOM, the simulation effort {[}i.e. environmental fluid
   dynamics code (EFDC)] was used to forecast the concentration of water
   quality variables to evaluate the lake trophic status under various
   conditions, while the optimization studies were used to identify the
   optimal water transfer strategies from a number of alternatives. To
   solve the model, a surrogate-based genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed
   in which the support vector regression (SVR) was used to create a set of
   easy-to-use and rapid-response surrogates for identifying the functional
   relationships between water transfer and lake trophic status. By
   replacing the EFDC and the corresponding trophic state index (TSI)
   equations with the surrogates, the computation efficiency could be
   improved. The developed ISOM was applied to the inter-basin water
   transfer management of the Niulanjiang-Dianchi Water Transfer Project
   (NDWTP) to support the eutrophication restoration of Lake Dianchi.
   Optimal water transfer schemes for three different remediation durations
   were generated from the model. The results demonstrated that NDWTP could
   exert a positive influence on the ecology and environment of Lake
   Dianchi, and that the trophic level for the Lake Dianchi could be
   effectively mitigated through the adoption of optimal water transfer
   schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigated vegetation in ravine habitats of Serbia, in order to
   classify hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.) forests in
   syntaxonomic terms, assess the effects of environmental factors on their
   floristic differentiation, and detect the biodiversity components of the
   analyzed communities. Both K-means clustering and Bayesian
   classification revealed five ecologically interpretable groups of
   forests that belong to the alliances Ostryo carpinifoliae-Fagion
   sylvaticae, Ostryo carpinifoliae-Tilion platyphylli, Fraxino
   orni-Ostryion carpinifoliae, Pseudofumario albae-Ostryion carpinifoliae,
   and Achilleo ageratifoliae-Ostryion carpinifoliae. Canonical
   correspondence analysis indicated that these alliances are clearly
   differentiated along a combined light-moisture gradient (from shade and
   mesic to sunny and xeric variants). The alpha diversity increases from
   xeric to mesic alliances. A lower alpha diversity in xeric forests may
   be explained by the stress conditions that prevent mesic species from
   colonizing the saxatile habitats. Extremely high-almost the greatest
   possible-values of both the species turnover and beta diversity were
   detected in all variants of the analyzed forests. Such high diversity
   may be the result of the strong environmental gradients in ravine
   habitats. The investigated forests represent an important pool of rare,
   paleo-endemic species that survived Quaternary glaciations in ravine
   refugia.},

Title = {Application of bioclimatic models coupled with network analysis for risk

Abstract = {In this study we use a combination of techniques to assess the general
   risk of invasion by the aquatic invader Dikerogammarus villosus in Great
   Britain at multiple scales. First, bioclimatic models (Support Vector
   Machine algorithm) were used to identify regions showing the highest
   climatic match with the European range of the species, and that might be
   at highest risk of initial colonization if provided with propagules. The
   model showed that nearly 60\% of Great Britain shows the minimum
   bioclimatic suitability for the species, particularly southern and
   eastern England. Afterwards, a Network Analysis was used to model the
   natural spatio-temporal spread of the killer shrimp in the Great Ouse
   River catchment (SE England), the first region invaded by this species.
   This model suggested that the northern part of the catchment, including
   two relevant Ramsar sites (Ouse Washes and Wicken fen) are at serious
   risk of being invaded in the short-term (<5 years). Taking into account
   the rapid spread of the killer shrimp in other European countries, its
   broad environmental tolerance, the high climate suitability of broad
   areas of Great Britain to the species, the current spread of other
   Ponto-Caspian species, and the high natural and artificial connectivity
   of the hydrological network, we conclude that D. villosus is very likely
   to continue its spread in Great Britain, dramatically affecting the
   native biodiversity. The multi-scale approach proposed in this study
   combines large-scale bioclimatic models with local-scale dispersal
   models, providing managers with a powerful spatial and temporal basis
   for informed decision-making.},

Abstract = {Understanding the ecological mechanisms that lead to extinction is a
   central goal of conservation. Can understanding ancient avian
   extinctions help to predict extinction risk in modern birds? I used
   classification trees trained on both paleoecological and historical data
   from islands across the Pacific to determine the ecological traits
   associated with extinction risk. Intrinsic traits, including endemism,
   large body size, and certain feeding guilds, were tightly linked with
   avian extinction over the past 3500 years. Species ecology and phylogeny
   were better predictors of extinction risk through time than extrinsic or
   abiotic factors. Although human impacts on birds and their habitats have
   changed over time, modern endangered birds share many of the same
   ecological characteristics as victims of previous extinction waves. My
   use of detailed predictions of extinction risk to identify species
   potentially in need of conservation attention demonstrates the utility
   of paleoecological knowledge for modern conservation biology.},

Abstract = {We propose a new data mining process to extract original knowledge from
   hydro-ecological data, in order to help the identification of pollution
   sources. This approach is based (1) on a domain knowledge discretization
   (quality classes) of physico-chemical and biological parameters, and (2)
   on an extraction of temporal patterns used as discriminant features to
   link physico-chemistry with biology in river sampling sites. For each
   bio-index quality value, we obtained a set of significant discriminant
   features. We used them to identify the physico-chemical characteristics
   that impact on different biological dimensions according to their
   presence in extracted knowledge. The experiments meet with the domain
   knowledge and also highlight significant mismatches between
   physico-chemical and biological quality classes. Then, we discuss about
   the interest of using discriminant temporal patterns for the exploration
   and the analysis of temporal environmental data such as hydro-ecological
   databases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Favourable habitats for Coffea inter-specific hybridization in central
   New Caledonia: combined genetic and spatial analyses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-95},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Human disturbance of natural habitats has increasingly promoted
   hybridization between previously isolated species. Coffee trees (Coffea
   canephora, C. liberica and C. arabica) have been introduced into New
   Caledonia for cultivation since the 1850s. Many plantations have since
   been abandoned, leaving the cultivars to evolve in natural conditions.
   This historical situation and the local environmental conditions have
   led to gene flow between sympatric species and the creation of hybrid
   zones which can be considered as a natural laboratory for studying gene
   flow dynamics. Our objectives were to assess the nature of these
   hybridizations and to model the distribution of habitats favourable for
   these hybrid zones at a regional scale.
   2. We analysed a tri-specific model population with 26 microsatellite
   markers using a multilocus analysis approach. We applied Bayesian
   methods to characterize the species identity of founder individuals and
   identify inter-specific hybrids. A high level of genetic diversity and
   inter-specific hybridization was observed in the population. To evaluate
   the presence of other favourable environments in the local area, a
   geographic information system was used to spatially differentiate the
   phenomenon and optimize future hybrid collecting missions. We
   constructed a predictive distribution model based on observation and
   environmental expertise (climatic parameters, physical parameters and
   landcover) at four reference sites of the hybrid zone.
   3. At all four sites the Coffea species were found to be involved in
   inter-specific hybridization, with one population, in particular,
   revealing high genetic diversity. According to the environmental
   expertise, 40\% of the studied region appeared to be favourable for this
   phenomenon and the model was validated with a prediction accuracy of
   79\%.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The use of microsatellite markers was
   efficient for assessing the nature and extent of coffee tree
   hybridization events. The environmental expertise and model allowed
   comparisons between New Caledonia and Africa ecological niches. This
   methodology may be recommended for better management of de novo in situ
   coffee genetic resources and applied to other plants to provide insight
   into the impact of adaptation to new environment. Combining
   environmental and species biological parameters would help in analysing
   modifications in plant reproductive behaviour induced by global climate
   change.},

Title = {Demography, education, and research trends in the interdisciplinary

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Number = {24},
Pages = {17581-17592},

Abstract = {Micro- and macroparasites are a leading cause of mortality for humans,
   animals, and plants, and there is great need to understand their
   origins, transmission dynamics, and impacts. Disease ecology formed as
   an interdisciplinary field in the 1970s to fill this need and has
   recently rapidly grown in size and influence. Because interdisciplinary
   fields integrate diverse scientific expertise and training experiences,
   understanding their composition and research priorities is often
   difficult. Here, for the first time, we quantify the composition and
   educational experiences of a subset of disease ecology practitioners and
   identify topical trends in published research. We combined a large
   survey of self-declared disease ecologists with a literature synthesis
   involving machine-learning topic detection of over 18,500 disease
   ecology research articles. The number of graduate degrees earned by
   disease ecology practitioners has grown dramatically since the early
   2000s. Similar to other science fields, we show that practitioners in
   disease ecology have diversified in the last decade in terms of gender
   identity and institution, with weaker diversification in race and
   ethnicity. Topic detection analysis revealed how the frequency of
   publications on certain topics has declined (e.g., HIV, serology),
   increased (e.g., the dilution effect, infectious disease in bats),
   remained relatively common (e.g., malaria ecology, influenza, vaccine
   research and development), or have consistently remained relatively
   infrequent (e.g., theoretical models, field experiments). Other topics,
   such as climate change, superspreading, emerging infectious diseases,
   and network analyses, have recently come to prominence. This study helps
   identify the major themes of disease ecology and demonstrates how
   publication frequency corresponds to emergent health and environmental
   threats. More broadly, our approach provides a framework to examine the
   composition and publication trends of other major research fields that
   cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.},

Title = {Effects of different artificial planting schemes on invasive weeds},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Weed invasion is the main reason affecting grassland productivity, which
   also serves as a key difficulty encountered during technical grassland
   restoration. Modern agriculture relies heavily on chemical herbicides to
   control weeds; however, this is not applicable to the restoration of
   degraded grasslands. In this study, artificial establishment methods
   employing interspecific competition were used to suppress weed invasion
   while greatly increasing grassland productivity.
   The establishment of different combinations and densities were then
   evaluated. Compared to the blank control block, the high-density
   planting of four pastures was found to reduce the types of invasive
   weeds by 69.4\% and the number of invasive weeds by 79.4\%. In addition,
   the individual biomass of weeds fell by 96.3\%. Moreover, 7.56 t hm-2
   dry weight of forage was provided in the first year, and 6.52 t hm-2 dry
   weight of forage was continuously provided in the second year, which had
   the best input-output ratio in this experiment. This study also
   demonstrated that the low-density mixed sowing scheme of the three
   forages can effectively inhibit the invasion of weeds, reducing the
   types of invasive weeds by 58.3\%, the number of invasive weeds by
   73.9\%, and the individual biomass of weeds by 89.1\%, which was the
   least economical investment among weed control programs. At the same
   time, unsupervised learning, which was included in the machine learning
   framework Scikit-learn, was used to verify the relationship between the
   establishment density of pasture and the number of weed invasive
   species. The results indicated that the contribution rate of Avena
   sativa and Elymus nutans to the number of invasive weed species was
   89.79\%. The present study demonstrated that artificial planting methods
   can effectively control weeds and increase pasture yields. Accordingly,
   they have great potential and research value in terms of ecological and
   economic recovery of degraded grasslands. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Title = {The shape of sound: A new R package that crosses the bridge between
   Bioacoustics and Geometric Morphometrics},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1115-1121},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The field of Bioacoustics has flourished in the past few decades, with
   numerous initiatives towards its application as a tool for biodiversity
   conservation. Despite the development of new methods involving
   computational programming and machine learning algorithms, higher
   accuracy is still needed for species identification, which is why we
   present herein the new SoundShape package for R platform.
   The new package focuses on implementing the eigensound method, a
   promising, and yet little explored protocol for bioacoustical analysis.
   The eigensound function is the main feature of SoundShape, allowing its
   user to convert sound waves into a dataset that can be analysed similar
   to coordinate sets from Geometric Morphometrics Methods, thus enabling
   the direct comparison between stereotyped calls from different species.
   Besides, SoundShape also features complementary functions for basic
   analysis of quantitative variation and illustration of hypothetical
   sound shapes representing the sample of sounds.
   Implementation of SoundShape is summarized through a workflow guide,
   using data from the new package. The sample study resulted in nearly
   90\% variation expressed in an ordination plot, therefore successfully
   summarizing complex sound waves previously described by large datasets
   of amplitude values. Moreover, we also introduce two addendums to
   eigensound: (a) three steps to prevent errors and biased results-aimed
   at securing a meaningful comparison between acoustic units from
   different species; and (b) the option of applying a logarithmic grid on
   the x-axis (time)-which emphasizes short duration calls while also
   encompassing long ones.
   SoundShape package now provide the tools required for anyone to
   replicate and implement the eigensound method on the r platform. This
   will enable future studies to focus on further exploring the
   applications of sound shape analysis on various scientific areas,
   including (but not limited to) taxonomy, systematics, evolution,
   acoustic niche partitioning, soundscape ecology and machine learning
   algorithms focused on species identification for conservation biology.},

Title = {A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from
   presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and
   describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making
   explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in
   producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and
   the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the
   characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for
   modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample
   bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the
   paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the
   model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities
   (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape)
   defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to
   be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that
   rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed
   explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and
   features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of
   model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization)
   and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to
   south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret
   them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this
   means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data
   for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate
   treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted
   species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the
   training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online
   appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical
   links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data,
   and further information on the case studies.},

Title = {The Phylogenetics and Biogeography of the Central Asian Hawkmoths, Hyles

   Clarity?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The western Palaearctic species of the hawkmoth genus Hyles
   (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) have long been the subject of molecular
   phylogenetic research. However, much less attention has been paid to the
   taxa inhabiting the central and eastern Palaearctic, particularly
   Central Asia, where almost 50\% of the species diversity of the genus
   occurs. Yet, many taxonomic conundrums hinder a proper assessment of the
   true diversity in these moths. One still unresolved group of species
   includes Hyles hippophaes and Hyles chamyla. Despite a largely
   overlapping morphology and ecology, a plethora of infraspecific taxa
   display some unique divergent characters over a wide geographical area.
   In this study, we undertook a taxonomic assessment of each population
   and resolved this species complex using an integrative approach. A
   combination of new computational techniques (DAISY-II) in comparative
   morphology and recent advances in DNA extraction methods and sequencing
   of museum specimens (WISC) alongside more traditional genetic approaches
   allowed testing of the three main phenotypes-bienerti, chamyla and
   apocyni-in terms of their morphological, mitochondrial and
   biogeographical integrity, and to elucidate their evolutionary
   relationships. Our results support the existence of two closely related
   species, Hyles chamyla and H. hippophaes, but the former species H.
   apocyni (here discussed as the ecological form apocyni of H. chamyla) is
   best regarded as a hybrid between H. chamyla and H. h. bienerti. The
   results indicate that the evolutionary relationship between H. chamyla
   and H. hippophaes is one of admixture in the context of ongoing
   ecological differentiation, which has led to shared morphological
   characters and a blurring of the species boundaries. These results
   clarify the evolutionary relationships of this species complex and open
   future research lines, including the analysis of nuclear markers and
   denser sampling, particularly of H. hippophaes and H. vespertilio in
   western Europe.},

Abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) explain spatial variation in
   community composition by contributions of the environment, biotic
   associations and possibly spatially structured residual covariance. They
   show great promise as a general analytical framework for community
   ecology and macroecology, but current JSDMs, even when approximated by
   latent variables, scale poorly on large datasets, limiting their
   usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g. metabarcoding and
   metagenomics) community datasets. Here, we present a novel, more
   scalable JSDM (sjSDM) that circumvents the need to use latent variables
   by using a Monte Carlo integration of the joint JSDM likelihood together
   with flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We
   implemented sjSDM in PyTorch, a modern machine learning framework, which
   allows making use of both CPU and GPU calculations. Using simulated
   communities with known species-species associations and different number
   of species and sites, we compare sjSDM with state-of-the-art JSDM
   implementations to determine computational runtimes and accuracy of the
   inferred species-species and species-environment associations. We find
   that sjSDM is orders of magnitude faster than existing JSDM algorithms
   (even when run on the CPU) and can be scaled to very large datasets.
   Despite the dramatically improved speed, sjSDM produces more accurate
   estimates of species association structures than alternative JSDM
   implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of sjSDM to big
   community data using eDNA case study with thousands of fungi operational
   taxonomic units (OTU). Our sjSDM approach makes the analysis of JSDMs to
   large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible,
   substantially extending the applicability of JSDMs in ecology. We
   provide our method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for
   practical data analysis.},

Title = {Phylogenetic diversity and community assembly in a naturally fragmented

Number = {24},
Pages = {18066-18080},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We sought to assess effects of fragmentation and quantify the
   contribution of ecological processes to community assembly by measuring
   species richness, phylogenetic, and phenotypic diversity of species
   found in local and regional plant communities. Specifically, our
   fragmented system is Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve,
   Idaho, USA. CRMO is characterized by vegetated islands, kipukas, that
   are isolated in a matrix of lava. We used floristic surveys of vascular
   plants in 19 kipukas to create a local species list to compare
   traditional dispersion metrics, mean pairwise distance, and mean nearest
   taxon distance (MPD and MNTD), to a regional species list with
   phenotypic and phylogenetic data. We combined phylogenetic and
   functional trait data in a novel machine-learning model selection
   approach, Community Assembly Model Inference (CAMI), to infer
   probability associated with different models of community assembly given
   the data. Finally, we used linear regression to explore whether the
   geography of kipukas explained estimated support for community assembly
   models. Using traditional metrics of MPD and MNTD neutral processes
   received the most support when comparing kipuka species to regional
   species. Individually no kipukas showed significant support for
   overdispersion. Rather, five kipukas showed significant support for
   phylogenetic clustering using MPD and two kipukas using MNTD. Using
   CAMI, we inferred neutral and filtering models structured the kipuka
   plant community for our trait of interest. Finally, we found as species
   richness in kipukas increases, model support for competition decreases
   and lower elevation kipukas show more support for habitat filtering
   models. While traditional phylogenetic community approaches suggest
   neutral assembly dynamics, recently developed approaches utilizing
   machine learning and model choice revealed joint influences of assembly
   processes to form the kipuka plant communities. Understanding ecological
   processes at play in naturally fragmented systems will aid in guiding
   our understanding of how fragmentation impacts future changes in
   landscapes.},

Title = {Modeling approach for coastal dune habitat detection on coastal
   ecosystems combining very high-resolution UAV imagery and field survey},

Abstract = {Earth observation (EO) data, derived from remote sensing and unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV), have been recently demonstrated to be essential
   tools for the ecosystem monitoring and habitat mapping, combining high
   technological and methodological procedures for applied ecology.
   However, research based on EO data analyses often tend to focus on image
   processing techniques, neglecting the development of a detailed sampling
   design scheme needed for an exhaustive habitat detection. This paper
   shows the results of a novel approach for mapping coastal dune habitats
   at a fine scale, using a supervised machine learning model, through the
   combination of vegetation plot sampling scheme, synergic use of
   multi-sensor spectral imagery (UAV-VHR) and environmental predictors
   (e.g., LiDAR), object-based image analysis, and landscape metrics
   analysis. Proposed approach was tested in a protected area, established
   to preserve notable habitats along the Italian Tyrrhenian coast. A
   detailed sampling scheme was designed and carried out during spring and
   summer of 2019, combining simultaneously UAV flight acquisition and
   field vegetation survey data, collected at high precision positioning.
   The calibrated classification model achieved an overall accuracy of
   78.6\% (standard error 4.33), allowing us to accurately classify and map
   five coastal habitats, according to EUNIS (European Nature Information
   System) classification, which were further verified through a fully
   independent validation field survey. Results demonstrate that VHR
   imageries, combined with specific field survey schemes, can be exploited
   to train classification models used for the detection of plant
   communities (i.e., meso-habitat) and plant species at local scale. Our
   findings demonstrate that UAV-VHR data is a valid tool to produce high
   spatial resolution information in sand beach ecosystems, giving ecology
   research a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective ecosystem
   monitoring.},

Title = {BHPMF-a hierarchical Bayesian approach to gap-filling and trait
   prediction for macroecology and functional biogeography},

Abstract = {Aim Functional traits of organisms are key to understanding and
   predicting biodiversity and ecological change, which motivates
   continuous collection of traits and their integration into global
   databases. Such trait matrices are inherently sparse, severely limiting
   their usefulness for further analyses. On the other hand, traits are
   characterized by the phylogenetic trait signal, trait-trait correlations
   and environmental constraints, all of which provide information that
   could be used to statistically fill gaps. We propose the application of
   probabilistic models which, for the first time, utilize all three
   characteristics to fill gaps in trait databases and predict trait values
   at larger spatial scales.
   Innovation For this purpose we introduce BHPMF, a hierarchical Bayesian
   extension of probabilistic matrix factorization ( PMF). PMF is a machine
   learning technique which exploits the correlation structure of sparse
   matrices to impute missing entries. BHPMF additionally utilizes the
   taxonomic hierarchy for trait prediction and provides uncertainty
   estimates for each imputation. In combination with multiple regression
   against environmental information, BHPMF allows for extrapolation from
   point measurements to larger spatial scales. We demonstrate the
   applicability of BHPMF in ecological contexts, using different plant
   functional trait datasets, also comparing results to taking the species
   mean and PMF.
   Main conclusions Sensitivity analyses validate the robustness and
   accuracy of BHPMF: our method captures the correlation structure of the
   trait matrix as well as the phylogenetic trait signal-also for extremely
   sparse trait matrices-and provides a robust measure of confidence in
   prediction accuracy for each missing entry. The combination of BHPMF
   with environmental constraints provides a promising concept to
   extrapolate traits beyond sampled regions, accounting for intraspecific
   trait variability. We conclude that BHPMF and its derivatives have a
   high potential to support future trait-based research in macroecology
   and functional biogeography.},

Title = {Automated content analysis: addressing the big literature challenge in

Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The exponential growth of scientific literature - which we call the big
   literature' phenomenon - has created great challenges in literature
   comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis
   processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to
   human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new
   literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. In this paper,
   we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated
   content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the
   fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine
   learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big
   literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research.
   Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA
   and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of
   literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and
   summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA
   studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing
   ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to
   maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential
   research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future
   ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike manual methods of
   literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature
   at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human
   biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for
   a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis,
   including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to
   address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive
   and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to
   fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the
   advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.},

Title = {Contemporary evolution and genetic change of prey as a response to
   predator removal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {13-22},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The ecological effects of predator removal and its consequence on prey
   behavior have been investigated widely; however, predator removal can
   also cause contemporary evolution of prey resulting in prey genetic
   change. Here we tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary
   evolution of prey traits such as movement, reproduction and foraging. We
   use EcoSim simulation which allows complex intra- and inter-specific
   interactions, based on individual evolving behavioral models, as well as
   complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous
   and heterogeneous worlds. We model organisms' behavior using fuzzy
   cognitive maps (FCM) that are coded in their genomes which has a clear
   semantics making reasoning about causality of any evolved behavior
   possible. We show that the contemporary evolution of prey behavior owing
   to predator removal is also accompanied by prey genetic change. We
   employed machine learning methods, now recognized as holding great
   promise for the advancement of our understanding and prediction of
   ecological phenomena. A classification algorithm was used to demonstrate
   the difference between genomes belonging to prey coevolving with
   predators and prey evolving in the absence of predation pressure. We
   argue that predator introductions to naive prey might be destabilizing
   if prey have evolved and adapted to the absence of predators. Our
   results suggest that both predator introductions and predator removal
   from an ecosystem have widespread effects on the survival and evolution
   of prey by altering their genomes and behavior, even after relatively
   short time intervals. Our study highlights the need to consider both
   ecological and evolutionary time scales, as well as the complex
   interplay of behaviors between trophic levels, in determining the
   outcomes of predator-prey interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In this paper, we outline some of the problems in computer learning,

   some cases, a decision graph may provide a solution to some of these
   problems. We compare a decision graph analysis with a decision tree
   analysis of salt marsh data, predicting predetermined vegetation types
   from environmental properties. All analyses use a minimum message length
   criterion to select an optimal model within a class, thereby avoiding
   subjective decisions. Minimum message length also provides a criterion
   for choosing between the model classes of tree and graph.
   In addition to the computational evaluation of models, we examine the
   ecological implications of the selected solutions. Even if sub-optimal,
   it is possible that a result can contribute to understanding of the
   underlying real system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An ECOLogical-ECONomic model (ECOLECON) has been developed to simulate
   animal population dynamics and economic revenues in response to
   different forest landscape structure and timber management scenarios.
   ECOLECON is a spatially-explicit, individual-based, and object-oriented
   program. It is coded in Borland C+ + 2.0 and contains 14 classes or
   subclasses of ecological and economic information which are
   hierarchically interlinked. ECOLECON can generate artificial forest
   landscapes or can link with geographic information systems (GIS) to run
   simulations on real landscapes. The model predicts population dynamics,
   spatial distribution, extinction probability of a species under
   consideration as well as future landscape structure, and economic income
   from timber harvest based on current tax and timber market situation.
   The model outputs provide valuable information for balancing the
   conflicts between the generation of economic revenues and the
   conservation of endangered species. Because ECOLECON is interactive and

Title = {restoptr: an R package for ecological restoration planning},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Ecological restoration is essential to curb the decline of biodiversity
   and ecosystems worldwide. Since the resources available for restoration
   are limited, restoration efforts must be cost-effective to achieve
   conservation outcomes. Although decision support tools are available to
   aid in the design of protected areas, little progress has been made to
   provide such tools for restoration efforts. Here, we introduce the
   restoptr R package, a decision support tool designed to identify
   priority areas for ecological res-toration. It uses constraint
   programming-an artificial intelligence technique-to identify optimal
   plans given ecological and socioeconomic constraints. Critically, it can
   identify strategic locations to enhance connectivity and reduce
   fragmentation across a broader landscape using complex landscape
   metrics. We illustrate its usage with a case study in New Caledonia. By
   applying this tool, we identified priority areas for restoration that
   could reverse forest fragmentation induced by mining activ-ities in a
   specific area. We also found that relatively small investments could
   deliver large returns to restore connectivity. The restoptr R package is
   a free and open-source decision support tool available on the
   Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://
   cran.r-project.org/package=restoptr).},

Abstract = {DNA-based methodology has proven to be a vital tool for ecosystem
   assessment and monitoring. Increasingly, high-throughput approaches such
   as DNA metabarcoding are being used to address more complex questions,
   including ecological network analyses through machine learning. Despite
   the technological advances which allow for such questions to be posed,
   there remains inherent limitations in studies utilizing DNA
   metabarcoding, referring to environmental sample type targeted,
   geographical coverage and lack of standardized field and laboratory
   procedures. Additionally, DNA reference databases are lacking
   information from taxa, resulting in unidentified sequences, and
   underrepresentation of some taxa. These issues need to be addressed to
   enable a more representative approach to ecosystem monitoring to allow
   for detection and monitoring of global ecosystem change.},

   rules for phytoplankton abundance in freshwater lakes from time series
   data. The suggested framework evolves several different equations and
   rules, based on limnological and climate variables. The results
   demonstrate that non-linear processes in natural systems may be
   successfully modelled through the use of evolutionary computation
   techniques. Further, it shows that a grammar based genetic programming
   system may be used as a tool for exploring the driving processes
   underlying freshwater system dynamics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Our review looks at recent advances in technologies applied to studying
   pollinators in the field. These include RFID, radar and lidar for

   `smart' hives); automated visual and audio monitoring systems including
   vision motion software for monitoring fine-scale pollinator behaviours
   over extended periods; and automated species identification systems
   based on machine learning that can vastly reduce the bottleneck in (big)
   data analysis. An improved e-ecology platform that leverages these tools
   is needed for ecologists to acquire and understand large spatiotemporal
   datasets, and thus inform knowledge gaps in environmental policymaking.
   Developing the next generation of e-ecology tools will require
   synergistic partnerships between academia and industry and significant
   investment in a cross-disciplinary scientific consortia.},

Abstract = {We foresee a new global-scale, ecological approach to biomonitoring
   emerging within the next decade that can detect ecosystem change
   accurately, cheaply, and generically. Next-generation sequencing of DNA
   sampled from the Earth's environments would provide data for the
   relative abundance of operational taxonomic units or ecological
   functions. Machine-learning methods would then be used to reconstruct
   the ecological networks of interactions implicit in the raw NGS data.
   Ultimately, we envision the development of autonomous samplers that
   would sample nucleic acids and upload NGS sequence data to the cloud for
   network reconstruction. Large numbers of these samplers, in a global
   array, would allow sensitive automated biomonitoring of the Earth's
   major ecosystems at high spatial and temporal resolution,
   revolutionising our understanding of ecosystem change.},

Title = {Risk of invasion predicted with support vector machines: A case study on
   northern pike (Esox Lucius, L.) and bleak (Alburnus alburnus, L.)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {342},
Pages = {123-134},
Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {The impacts of invasive species are recognised as a major threat to
   global freshwater biodiversity. The risk of invasion (probability of
   presence) of two avowed invasive species, the northern pike (Esox
   Lucius, L.) and bleak (Alburnus alburnus, L.), was evaluated in the
   upper part of the Cabriel River (eastern Iberian Peninsula). Habitat
   suitability models for these invasive species were developed with
   Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which were trained with data collected
   downstream the Contreras dam (the last barrier impeding the invasion of
   the upper river segment). Although SVMs gained visibility in habitat
   suitability modelling, they cannot be considered widespread in ecology.
   Thus, with this technique, there is certain controversy about the
   necessity of performing variable selection procedures. In this study,
   the parameters tuning and the variable selection for the SVMs was
   simultaneously performed with a genetic algorithm and, contradicting
   previous studies in freshwater ecology, the variable selection proved
   necessary to achieve almost perfect accuracy. Further, the development
   of partial dependence plots allowed unveiling the relationship between
   the selected input variables and the probability of presence. Results
   revealed the preference of northern pike for large and wide mesohabitats
   with vegetated shores and abundant prey whereas bleak preferred deep and
   slightly fast flow mesohabitats with fine substrate. Both species proved
   able to colonize the upper part of the Cabriel River but the habitat
   suitability for bleak indicated a slightly higher risk of invasion.
   Altogether may threaten the endemic species that actually inhabit that
   stretch, especially the Jucar nase (Parachondrostoma arrigonis;
   Steindachner), which is one of the most critically endangered Iberian
   freshwater fish species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Wilding conifers, the naturally regenerated scions of exotic conifer
   species, are a major ecological and economic issue in New Zealand.
   Hyperspectral imagery could provide a useful means of monitoring the
   efficacy of wilding control measures but little research has examined
   this possibility. Data were collected from an experiment, that included
   thirty-nine young Pinus contorta (Douglas) trees allocated to a control
   and two herbicide treatments (triclopyr butoxyethyl ester and diquat
   dibromide monohydrate). The objectives of this research were to examine
   the temporal impacts of herbicide on needle discolouration, spectral
   properties and tree physiology and to develop models to predict
   photosynthetic parameters from hyperspectral data. In accordance with
   obvious discolouration on the first day after treatment, values of net
   photosynthesis rate (A), electron transport rate (ETR), stomatal
   conductance (G) and optimal quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m)
   declined rapidly for plants treated with diquat. Discolouration
   following application of triclopyr was not evident before the second
   week, and values of A, ETR, G and F-v/F-m declined slower than those of
   diquat. Of the tested narrow-band spectral indices calculated from
   needle spectra photochemical reflectance index (PRI) exhibited the
   strongest correlation with the four photosynthetic parameters and R-2
   values between PRI and A, F-v/F-m, ETR and G were, respectively, 0.53,
   0.46, 0.68 and 0.29. Models that used raw spectra as inputs showed that
   sparse partial least squares (SPLS) outperformed the three other
   approaches tested (PLS, Support Vector Machines, Elastic Net) and R-2
   values using this approach for A, F-v/F-m, ETR and G were, respectively,
   0.64, 0.62, 0.65 and 0.42.},

Abstract = {The management of animal endangered species requires detailed
   information on their distribution and abundance, which is often hard to
   obtain. When animals communicate using sounds, one option is to use
   automatic sound recorders to gather information on the species for long
   periods of time with low effort. One drawback of this method is that
   processing all the information manually requires large amounts of time
   and effort. Our objective was to create a relatively user-friendly
   (i.e., that does not require big programming skills) automatic detection
   algorithm to improve our ability to get basic data from sound-emitting
   animal species. We illustrate our algorithm by showing two possible
   applications with the Hawai'i Amakihi, Hemignathus virens virens, a
   forest bird from the island of Hawai'i. We first characterized the
   Amakihi song using recordings from areas where the species is present in
   high densities. We used this information to train a classification
   algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), in order to identify
   Amakihi songs from a series of potential songs. We then used our
   algorithm to detect the species in areas where its presence had not been
   previously confirmed. We also used the algorithm to compare the relative
   abundance of the species in different areas where management actions may
   be applied. The SVM had an accuracy of 86.5\% in identifying Amakihi. We
   confirmed the presence of the Amakihi at the study area using the
   algorithm. We also found that the relative abundance of Amakihi changes
   among study areas, and this information can be used to assess where
   management strategies for the species should be better implemented. Our
   automatic song detection algorithm is effective, user-friendly and can
   be very useful for optimizing the management and conservation of those
   endangered animal species that communicate acoustically.},

Volume = {179},
Number = {4},
Pages = {545-553},

Abstract = {Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain size changes in insular
   mammals, but no single variable suffices to explain the diversity of
   responses, particularly within Rodentia. Here in a data set on insular
   rodents, we observe strong consistency in the direction of size change
   within islands and within species but (outside of Heteromyidae) little
   consistency at broader taxonomic scales. Using traits of islands and of
   species in a classification tree analysis, we find the most important
   factor predicting direction of change to be mainland body mass (large
   rodents decrease, small ones increase); other variables (island climate,
   number of rodent species, and area) were significant, although their
   roles as revealed by the classification tree were context dependent.
   Ecological interactions appear relatively uninformative, and on any
   given island, the largest and smallest rodent species converged or
   diverged in size with equal frequency. Our approach provides a promising
   framework for continuing examination of insular body size evolution.},

Abstract = {A study was undertaken to investigate whether appropriate environmental

   transmission in the landscape. The ecology of infectious diseases, using
   Lyme disease as a case study, was investigated to determine critical
   interactions between infectious disease and humans in the landscape.
   Knowledge of the life cycle of the disease's hosts revealed the critical
   times and places where interactions, and possible infections of humans,
   are most likely to occur. This information was incorporated into a
   decision tree framework and a landscape features checklist that will
   allow landscape planners and designers to determine approaches that will
   minimize the risk of infection in humans. A series of planning, design,
   and management guidelines were developed, and their application should
   assist in lowering the likelihood of humans contracting Lyme disease in
   the landscape. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A map of the vegetation of the Catskill Park, NY, was created using
   multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper TM data and ancillary spatial
   data to support ecological studies in Catskill watersheds. The map
   emphasizes forest types defined by dominant tree species and depicts 24
   vegetation classes. Mapping included a series Of Supervised
   classifications in a decision tree framework that allowed forest types
   to be distinguished using spectral characteristics and other
   environmental relationships (e.g., landscape position, elevation).
   Traditional contingency table analysis (based on limited ground
   sampling) suggests overall map accuracy ranging from 28\% to 90\%,
   depending on the level of aggregation of the original 24 map classes.
   Fuzzy accuracy assessment based on the same ground data suggests a 71\%
   level of acceptable classification. The map indicates that
   maple-dominated forests are predominant in the Catskill region, but that
   beech and birch-dorninated forests become more important at higher
   elevations. Oak-dominated forests are very important along the eastern
   side of the Catskills, and conifer-dominated forests are largely
   restricted to mountaintops and stream bottoms.},

Title = {Agroecosystem research with big data and a modified scientific method
   using machine learning concepts},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Long-term studies of agroecosystems distributed across the North
   American continent are providing an extraordinary understanding of
   regional environmental dynamics. The new Long-Term Agro-ecosystem
   Research (LTAR) network (organized in 2012) has designed an explicit
   cross-site research program with multiple U.S. Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) experimental watersheds, ranges, and forests. Here, we report
   results from studies using a modified scientific method that includes
   learning through time that was implemented over the past five years with
   long-term data from USDA experimental sites in coordination with other
   networks. The results offer a compelling argument for the LTAR concept
   of combining site-based expertise with network-wide coordination and
   collaboration to arrive at more accurate scientific conclusions than
   possible from individual researchers working alone. Simply put, without
   site-based expertise and cross-site communication working in parallel to
   provide input, feedback, and refinement to each subsequent step, similar
   to the way machine learning works, the interpretations and conclusions
   of these studies would have been incomplete, if not incorrect. Further,
   the up-front time commitment to data processing and analytics above the
   time dedicated to place-based studies increased the productivity of the
   team and the impact of the research, unlike the common perception that
   cross-site research is often less efficient. In turn, this approach
   supported a non-traditional system of credit for co-authors based on
   citation impact of the journal selected as the publication outlet with
   less regard for author order. The LTAR network has embraced this
   modified scientific method in its shared research strategy and common
   experiment to address the problematic issues of mixed data quality
   across studies and sites, co-author credit, research efficiency, and
   scientific impact on data-intensive research. This approach can be
   combined with other types of collaborative and social media approaches,
   such as crowdsourcing, to take advantage of the wide range of expertise
   in the agroecological community as well as other disciplines to move
   science forward in the time of big data.},

Abstract = {Arctic warming associated with global climate change poses a significant
   threat to populations of wildlife in the Arctic. Since lipids play a
   vital role in adaptation of organisms to variations in temperature,
   high-resolution mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics can provide insights
   into adaptive responses of organisms to a warmer environment in the
   Arctic and help to illustrate potential novel roles of lipids in the
   process of thermal adaption. In this study, we studied an ecologically
   and economically important species-Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus)-with
   a detailed multi-tissue analysis of the lipidome in response to chronic
   shifts in temperature using a validated lipidomics workflow. In
   addition, dynamic alterations in the hepatic lipidome during the time
   course of shifts in temperature were also characterized. Our results
   showed that early life stages of Arctic char were more susceptible to
   variations in temperature. One-year-old Arctic char responded to chronic
   increases in temperature with coordinated regulation of lipids,
   including headgroup-specific remodeling of acyl chains in
   glycerophospholipids (GP) and extensive alterations in composition of
   lipids in membranes, such as less lyso-GPs, and more ether-GPs and
   sphingomyelin. Glycerolipids (e.g., triacylglycerol, TG) also
   participated in adaptive responses of the lipidome of Arctic char.
   Eight-week-old Arctic char exhibited rapid adaptive alterations of the
   hepatic lipidome to stepwise decreases in temperature while showing
   blunted responses to gradual increases in temperature, implying an
   inability to adapt rapidly to warmer environments. Three common
   phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) (PE 36:6|PE 16:1\_20:5, PE 38:7|PE
   16:1\_22:6, and PE 40:7|PE 18:1\_22:6) were finally identified as
   candidate lipid biomarkers for temperature shifts via machine learning
   approach. Overall, this work provides additional information to a better
   understanding of underlying regulatory mechanisms of the lipidome of
   Arctic organisms in the face of near-future warming.},

Abstract = {We present here the potential synergies between a sub-discipline of
   music called computational musicology and its associated toolkit Music
   Information Retrieval (MIR) systems and the current needs of soundscape
   ecologists who use passive acoustic recorders to collect massive amounts
   of audio data. These cross-sub disciplinary synergies fall into three
   broad methodological categories: (1) automated feature extraction, (2)
   sound classification and labeling using machine learning, and (3) data
   visualization. We argue that the use of the MIR toolkit by soundscape
   ecologists could represent the development of a second generation of
   soundscape metrics, which are more translatable to policy and natural
   resource management problems. Two companion articles in this special
   issue by the authors provide a more detailed examination of the
   potential for computational musicology's MIR toolkit as applied to
   questions common to the emerging field of soundscape ecology.},

Title = {Large size (>100-mu m) microplastics are not biomagnifying in coastal
   marine food webs of British Columbia, Canada},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) contamination in marine environments is of
   increasing concern, as plastic particles are globally ubiquitous across
   ecosystems. A large variety of aquatic taxa ingest MPs, but the extent
   to which animals accumulate and transfer MPs through food webs is
   largely unknown. In this study, we quantified MP uptake in bivalves,
   crabs, echinoderms, and fish feeding at different trophic levels at
   three sites on southern Vancouver Island. We paired stable-isotope food
   web analysis with MP concentrations in digestive tracts across all
   trophic levels and in fish livers. We then used Bayesian generalized
   linear mixed models to explore whether bioaccumulation and
   biomagnification were occurring. Our results showed that MPs (100-5000
   mu m along their longest dimension) are not biomagnifying in marine
   coastal food webs, with no correlation between the digestive tract or
   fish liver MP concentrations and trophic position of the various
   species. Ecological traits did, however, affect microplastic
   accumulation in digestive tracts, with suspension feeder and
   smaller-bodied planktivorous fish ingesting more MPs by body weight.
   Trophic transfer occurred between prey and predator for rockfish, but
   higher concentrations in full stomachs compared with empty ones
   suggested rapid excretion of ingested MPs. Collectively, our findings
   suggested the movement of MP through marine food webs is facilitated by
   species-specific mechanisms, with contamination susceptibility a
   function of species biology, not trophic position. Furthermore, the
   statistical methods we employ, including machine learning for
   classifying unknown particles and a probabilistic way to account for
   background contamination, are universally applicable to the study of
   microplastics. Our findings advance understanding of how MPs enter and
   move through aquatic food webs, suggesting that lower-trophic-level
   animals are more at risk of ingesting >100-mu m MPs, relative to
   higher-trophic-level animals. Our work also highlights the need to
   advance the study of <100-mu m MPs, which are still poorly understood
   and may need to be considered separately in ecological risk assessments.},

Abstract = {Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a convenient
   mathematical model to solve sequential decision-making problems under
   imperfect observations. Most notably for ecologists, POMDPs have helped
   solve the trade-offs between investing in management or surveillance
   and, more recently, to optimise adaptive management problems. Despite an
   increasing number of applications in ecology and natural resources,
   POMDPs are still poorly understood. The complexity of the mathematics,
   the inaccessibility of POMDP solvers developed by the Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) community, and the lack of introductory material are
   likely reasons for this. We propose to bridge this gap by providing a
   primer on POMDPs, a typology of case studies drawn from the literature,
   and a repository of POMDP problems. We explain the steps required to
   define a POMDP when the state of the system is imperfectly detected
   (state uncertainty) and when the dynamics of the system are unknown
   (model uncertainty). We provide input files and solutions to a selected
   number of problems, reflect on lessons learned applying these models
   over the last 10 years and discuss future research required on
   interpretable AI. Partially observable Markov decision processes are
   powerful decision models that allow users to make decisions under
   imperfect observations over time. This primer will provide a much-needed
   entry point to ecologists.},

Abstract = {Single-species toxicity tests are inadequate to predict the effects of
   chemicals in ecological communities although they provide data on the
   relative toxicity of different chemicals, and on the relative
   sensitivity of different organisms. Only multispecies studies can
   provide demonstrations of: (1) indirect trophic-level effects, including
   increased abundances of species via increased food supply through
   reduced competition or reduced predation; (2) compensatory shifts within
   a trophic level; (3) responses to chemicals within the context of
   seasonal patterns that modify water chemistry and birth and death rates
   of populations; (4) chemical transformations by some organisms having
   effects on other organisms; and (5) persistence of parent and
   transformation products.
   Multispecies laboratory studies, such as the Standardized Aquatic
   Microcosm, have much to offer, with advantages of statistical power,
   speed of analyses, demonstrated reproducibility among laboratories, and
   modest expense (compared to held studies). The use of a chemically
   defined sediment facilitates the potential extraction of parent and
   transformation products by minimizing the problem of unextractable
   residues. The absence of fish prevents the potential elimination of
   zooplankton if fish predation exceeds production. Standardized Aquatic
   Microcosms also offer a wealth of analytical tools, including rapid
   statistical analyses, a mathematical model (MICMOD), and artificial
   intelligence methodologies.},

Abstract = {1. Quantitative ecospace models are a numerical approach to comparing
   the functional structure of different ecosystems on macroevolutionary
   time-scales, by quantifying the distribution of functional ecological
   traits. Ecospace modelling has historically been restricted to a
   combination of visual interpretation and quantification via metrics such
   as mean sum of ranges. We argue that comparing ecosystem function in
   this way overlooks critical information about degrees of overlap and
   redundancy, and potentially misrepresents the role of ``empty
   ecospace{''} in driving macroevolution. Fuzzy ecospace modelling (FEM)
   places conventional ecospace modelling within a fuzzy set-theoretic
   framework, wherein functional groups are learned from the dataset,
   creating models which are sensitive to overlap and the role of empty
   ecospace.
   2. Fuzzy ecospace modelling is a machine learning program which
   quantifies functional ecological similarity, and uses this information
   to classify new taxa. It creates functional groups using a Gower
   dissimilarity coefficient-based approach to the k-medoids algorithm, and
   uses fuzzy discriminant analysis to classify the taxa present in another
   ecosystem into these clusters, based on minimal Gower dissimilarity with
   a fuzzy threshold. This has the effect of quantifying the similarity
   between these ecosystems in terms of their functional groups, accounting
   for total redundancy, partial redundancy/ novelty and total novelty.
   3. By using fuzzy membership functions, FEM can classify taxa which are
   highly ecologically dissimilar (outliers with respect to all functional
   groups), taxa which are fully redundant (100\% similarity to those in a
   given functional group) and taxa in-between, which represent degrees of
   niche overlap. This can be used to compare the functional groups present
   in different ecosystems (as well as their degrees of overlap), and as a
   metric approach to comparing total ecological disparity. These results
   can be used to test models of the role of empty ecospace in
   macroevolutionary trends, or to investigate how ecosystems respond to
   global perturbations. Furthermore, it allows us to define numerically
   the concept of empty ecospace for n-dimensional datasets.
   4. A cluster-based approach to the quantification of ecospace allows for
   a numerical estimate of niche overlap, a value particularly difficult to
   quantify in fossil contexts.},

Abstract = {As ecology enters a critical era, more comprehensive studies are needed
   to improve our understanding of the key themes, major trends, and
   potential gaps within the discipline. However, as the number of
   published scientific papers continues to grow, tracking the
   ever-expanding body of work becomes increasingly challenging. To
   identify trends in ecological research, we used recently developed
   machine learning techniques to perform an automated content analysis on
   over 84,841 articles published in 33 top-ranked scientific journals over
   the past four decades. We detected a clear decline in the relative
   frequency of classical theoretical research, and increases in
   data-intensive research at both micro- and macroscales and on
   anthropogenic themes. Scattered around the periphery of the expanding
   thematic space, themes such as microbial ecology, genetics,
   biogeochemistry, and management and policy have all increased in
   relative frequency. New educational and research frameworks, as well as
   funding priorities, should incorporate these contemporary themes so that
   the field of ecology can better address societal challenges.},

Abstract = {Most ecologists use statistical methods as their main analytical tools
   when analyzing data to identify relationships between a response and a

   exercises in parameter estimation. However, little or no prior knowledge
   about a system can lead to creation of a statistical model or models
   that do not accurately describe major sources of variation in the
   response variable. We suggest that under such circumstances data mining
   is more appropriate for analysis. lit this paper we 1) present the
   distinctions between data-mining (usually exploratory) analyses and
   parametric statistical (confirmatory) analyses, 2) illustrate 3
   strengths of data-mining tools for generating hypotheses from data, and
   3) suggest useful ways in which data mining and statistical analyses can
   be integrated into a thorough analysis of data to facilitate rapid
   creation of accurate models and to guide further research.},

Title = {Quantifying the temporal stability in seasonal habitat for sage-grouse
   using regression and ensemble tree approaches},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Identifying and quantifying the extent to which landscape-level habitat
   variables drive the spatial distribution of individuals across a region
   can provide fundamental insights into a species ecology and be essential
   to wildlife management and conservation plans. Although the preferences
   for habitat resources and the resources themselves are not static over
   time, most research at large spatial scales does not consider seasonal
   effects nor quantify annual temporal variability in the spatial
   distribution of habitat resources. In this study, we used a machine
   learning (boosted regression trees {[}BRTs]) and generalized linear
   mixed model (GLMM) approach to quantify seasonal habitat selection
   across three life stages (nest, late brood, and winter habitat) of
   sage-grouse and estimated annual stability across a 13-year dataset in
   south-central Wyoming. Generalized linear mixed models had high area
   under the curve (AUC) values, but were not as high as the BRT models
   that had mean AUC values of 0.86, 0.81, and 0.87 for nest, late brood,
   and winter habitat, respectively. Generalized linear mixed models and
   BRT result provided similar results, but because of the higher
   validation values of the BRT models, we assessed annual variation by
   predicting the BRT models across years. We found significant spatial
   trends in the distribution of nesting habitat, with general decreases in
   the relative probability of use across the core of the study area and
   corresponding increases in selection on the periphery. The primary
   temporally shifting variables for the nesting BRT models were
   development, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and topographic
   wetness, suggesting they were shifting out of preferable ranges for
   these variables as habitat suitability was decreased over the course of
   our study. Winter habitat appeared to have similar spatial changes in
   probability of selection, but these changes were likely related to
   changes in winter precipitation and snow depth, which were the primary
   contributors to the winter BRT models. The annual dynamics of habitat
   selection are seldom addressed in large-scale research but can have
   potentially dramatic influences on our identification of preferred
   habitats.},

Title = {Comparing outcomes from competing models assessing environmental flows
   in the Minnesota River Basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {142},
Number = {S},
Abstract = {The ability to predictively link river hydrology to ecological effects
   (i.e., flow-ecology relationships) is central to understanding
   consequences of alternative freshwater management strategies and
   transparently making trade-offs. While myriad techniques for developing
   flow-ecology relationships exist, water managers are often concerned
   about not only model type, but also capacity to reliably predict
   ecological responses. Here, we develop flow-ecology relationships with
   three contrasting model development philosophies and examine consistency
   and robustness of model outcomes as the models are applied to six future
   land use scenarios in the Minnesota River Basin. All three models are
   developed from two data sources distributed across the basin: (1) 18
   years of modeled streamflow hydrology at 1016 locations and (2) 463 fish
   richness monitoring events at 314 locations. Model-1 assumes hydrologic
   change alone is indicative of ecological response, and the relative
   change in seven synthetic streamflow statistics is applied as a metric
   of ecological impact. Model-2 develops flow-ecology relationships from a
   traditional, deductive modeling approach using dimensional analysis and
   linear regression, which assumes model adoption will increase if the
   tool is transparent and based on ecological and hydrological principles.
   Model-3 applies an inductive, machine-learning model (boosted regression
   trees) to develop flow-ecology relationships, which assumes that lost
   transparency in modeling is an acceptable tradeoff for increased
   predictive power. All three models were applied to six ``alternative
   futures{''} (i.e., land use scenarios) in the Minnesota River Basin.
   Hydrologic model outcomes (Model-1) show large quantitative responses to
   land use change and provided a useful intermediate outcome for
   communicating how land use change alters dimensions of streamflow.
   Although structurally simple, Model-2 estimated fish richness with
   reasonable predictive accuracy (R-2 = 0.38), and dimensional analysis
   provided a powerful mechanism for scaling predictions across a range of
   watershed sizes. Although opaque in the ability to visualize outcomes,
   the machine learning method (Model-3) estimated fish richness with high
   predictive accuracy (R-2 = 0.73), which may be an acceptable trade-off
   to managers. When applied to six land use scenarios, all three models
   generally predict qualitatively similar outcomes (e.g., the increased
   agricultural development scenario has greater ecological impacts than
   scenarios emphasizing biodiversity or water quality).},

Title = {Local geographic range predicts freshwater fish extinctions in Singapore},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {356-363},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {P>1. Identifying the ecological and life-history correlates of local
   extinction may elucidate mechanisms by which species traits and the
   environment interact to result in extinctions, and will help to predict
   and target extinction-prone species for inclusion in conservation
   programmes. Freshwater habitats are known to be highly threatened in
   Southeast Asia but the correlates of extinction among tropical
   freshwater fish remains unclear.
   2. To bridge this knowledge gap, we examined extinction correlates of
   the freshwater fish of Singapore using machine learning methods:
   conditional inference trees and forests. Singapore is an ideal study
   site as it has experienced a high degree of habitat loss and has a
   well-studied ichthyofauna compared with other countries in the region.
   3. The local range of a species was the only significant predictor of
   extinctions: range-restricted species were more likely to go extinct.
   4. Other traits found to be important predictors of extinction risk in
   temperate regions or hypothesized to predict extinctions based on theory
   included regional geographic distribution, vertical position, feeding
   guild, body size, number of congeners, air-breathing capability and
   habitat preference. These factors did not appear to drive extinctions of
   freshwater fish in Singapore, although forest-dependent species are more
   likely to have a restricted local range.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Local extinctions of freshwater fish in
   Singapore are random with respect to ecological and life-history traits
   because habitat loss is responsible for the removal of entire
   populations. The fish fauna of Southeast Asia is so poorly known that
   intensive field surveys are required to identify hotspots of freshwater
   fish endemism which may be vulnerable to future extinction. These
   hotspots should then be incorporated into national conservation plans.
   Where complete habitat protection is not possible, for example, in
   existing logging concessions and plantations, local authorities should
   establish partnerships with management companies to ameliorate impacts
   on fish fauna. Within Singapore, the Nee Soon Swamp Forest is one such
   hotspot of fish endemism and must be conserved to protect the last
   populations of five fish species endemic to this location on the island.},

Abstract = {How do social-ecological systems change over time? In 2002 C. S. Holling
   and colleagues proposed the concept of panarchy, which presented
   social-ecological systems as an interacting set of adaptive cycles, each
   produced by the dynamic tensions between novelty and efficiency at
   multiple scales. Initially introduced as a conceptual framework and set
   of metaphors, panarchy has gained the attention of scholars across many
   disciplines, and its ideas continue to inspire further conceptual
   developments. Almost 20 years after this concept was introduced, we
   reviewed how it has been used, tested, extended, and revised, through
   the combination of qualitative methods and machine learning. Document
   analysis was used to code panarchy features common to the scientific
   literature (N = 42), a qualitative analysis that was complemented with
   topic modeling of 2177 documents. We found that the adaptive cycle is
   the feature of panarchy that has attracted the most attention.
   Challenges remain in empirically grounding the metaphor, but recent
   theoretical and empirical work offer some avenues for future research.},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques were originally
   developed in the mid-1980s. In this century they are gaining increasing
   attention in the literature and in practical use as a powerful tool to
   support forest management strategies especially under climate change. In
   this review paper we consider species occurrence datasets, climatic and
   soil predictor variables, modelling algorithms, evaluation methods and
   widely used software for SDM studies. We describe several important and
   freely available sources for species occurrence and interpolated
   climatic data. We outline the use of both presence-only and
   presence/absence modelling algorithms including distance-based
   algorithms, machine learning algorithms and regression-based models. We
   conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest
   managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the
   use of future climate change scenarios.},

Title = {Analysing land-cover changes in relation to environmental variables in
   Hesse, Germany},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {473-489},
Abstract = {Land-use and land-cover changes affect ecological landscape functions
   and processes. Hence, landscape ecologists have a central interest in a
   comprehensive understanding of such changes. Our study focuses on the
   relationships between environmental conditions and agricultural
   land-cover changes. We present a method to (i) characterise the major
   spatial-temporal processes of land-cover changes, (ii) identify the
   correlations between environmental attributes and land-cover changes and
   (iii) derive potential environmental drivers of land-cover changes in a
   German marginal rural landscape. The method was applied to study
   land-cover dynamics from 1945 to 1998 in the districts of Erda,
   Steinbrucken and Eibelshausen, situated in the marginal rural landscape
   of the Lahn-Dill Highlands, Germany. We employed land-cover data gained
   by the interpretation of multi-temporal aerial photographs. Various
   environmental variables were introduced into the analyses. We identified
   physical landscape attributes (elevation, slope, aspect, available water
   capacity and soil texture) and structural landscape dimensions (patch
   size, patch shape and distance between patch and nearest settlement).
   With the aid of GIS, K-means partitioning and canonical correspondence
   analysis, we investigated land-cover trajectory types, land-cover
   transitions at individual time intervals and their relationships to
   these environmental variables. Our results show that, between 1945 and
   1998, land-cover changes correlated with the physical attributes of the
   underlying landscape. On the other hand, the structural landscape
   dimensions correlated with land cover only in periods of minor
   land-cover changes (1972-98). Greater diversity of physical landscape
   attributes is correlated with greater land-cover dynamics. Besides the
   important influence of socio-economic factors, land-cover changes in the
   study areas took place within the relatively stable physical constraints
   of the underlying landscape.},

Title = {Acoustic evaluation of behavioral states predicted from GPS tracking: a
   case study of a marine fishing bat},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {BackgroundMultiple methods have been developed to infer behavioral
   states from animal movement data, but rarely has their accuracy been
   assessed from independent evidence, especially for location data sampled
   with high temporal resolution. Here we evaluate the performance of
   behavioral segmentation methods using acoustic recordings that monitor
   prey capture attempts.MethodsWe recorded GPS locations and ultrasonic
   audio during the foraging trips of 11 Mexican fish-eating bats, Myotis
   vivesi, using miniature bio-loggers. We then applied five different
   segmentation algorithms (k-means clustering, expectation-maximization
   and binary clustering, first-passage time, hidden Markov models, and
   correlated velocity change point analysis) to infer two behavioral
   states, foraging and commuting, from the GPS data. To evaluate the
   inference, we independently identified characteristic patterns of
   biosonar calls (feeding buzzes) that occur during foraging in the audio
   recordings. We then compared segmentation methods on how well they
   correctly identified the two behaviors and if their estimates of
   foraging movement parameters matched those for locations with
   buzzes.ResultsWhile the five methods differed in the median percentage
   of buzzes occurring during predicted foraging events, or true positive
   rate (44-75\%), a two-state hidden Markov model had the highest median
   balanced accuracy (67\%). Hidden Markov models and first-passage time
   predicted foraging flight speeds and turn angles similar to those
   measured at locations with feeding buzzes and did not differ in the
   number or duration of predicted foraging events.ConclusionThe hidden
   Markov model method performed best at identifying fish-eating bat
   foraging segments; however, first-passage time was not significantly
   different and gave similar parameter estimates. This is the first
   attempt to evaluate segmentation methodologies in echolocating bats and
   provides an evaluation framework that can be used on other species.},

Title = {Environmental Issues on Color Quality Evaluation of Blue Sapphire based

Journal = {EKOLOJI},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {106},
Pages = {1365-1376},
Abstract = {This article seeks to evaluate color quality of blue sapphire and also
   address environmental impacts related to precious stones. Mining for
   gold, silver, diamonds, sapphires, gemstones, and other metals can
   result in water pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and soil erosion.
   Through the measurement, screening and analysis of color parameters of
   Gem Dialogue TM Color Comparison Charts, the feasibility of its
   application to the color evaluation of blue sapphire was explored in
   terms of ecological evaluation. Charts with strong blue tone in
   Gemdialoguet (TM) Color Comparison Charts--charts G2B, CYAN, B, P2B and
   B2P--were measured under illuminants A, D65 and CWF, by X-rite SP60
   Portable spectrophotometer. The law of the charts color variation,
   environmental issues and the influence of illuminant variation on color
   were explored. And D65 is recommended to be used as the color comparison
   and ecological evaluation illuminant of blue sapphire. Screen the
   measured data in reference to the specified color range of Chinese
   National Standard ``GB/T 32862-2016 Sapphire Grading{''}. The valid
   color data was classified into five categories through K-Means
   clustering analysis of SPSS21.0 and taxonomic ecology, and the taxonomy
   accuracy rate reached 98.3\% by the verifying of Fisher analysis.
   Combined with the environmental effect of color simulation, the result
   of classification was ecologically accurate and ideal. Applying the
   Gemdialogue (TM) Color Comparison Charts to the color quality evaluation
   of blue sapphire is practicable. By screening the data according to the
   environmental characteristics of different gems, this method can be
   extended to help establish the color evaluation system of other blue
   color gems. It is also suggested to support organizations working to
   improve the global mining industry. Ethical Metal Smiths and Fair
   Jewelry Action are two such organizations.},

Title = {A new approach to ecological land classification for the Canadian boreal
   forest that integrates disturbances},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Traditional approaches to ecological land classification (ELC) can be
   enhanced by integrating, a priori, data describing disturbances (natural
   and human), in addition to the usual vegetation, climate, and physical
   environment data. To develop this new ELC model, we studied an area of
   about 175,000 km(2) in the Abies balsamea-Betula papyrifera and Picea
   mariana-feathermoss bioclimatic domains of the boreal forest of Qu,bec,
   in eastern Canada. Forest inventory plots and maps produced by the
   MinistSre des Ressources naturelles du Qu,bec from 1970 to 2000 were
   used to characterize 606 ecological districts (average area 200 km(2))
   according to three vegetation themes (tree species, forest types, and
   potential vegetation-successional stages) and four sets of explanatory
   variables (climate, physical environment, natural and human
   disturbances). Redundancy, cluster (K-means) and variation partitioning
   analyses were used to delineate, describe, and compare homogeneous
   vegetation landscapes. The resulting ELC is hierarchical with three
   levels of observation. Among the 14 homogeneous landscapes composing the
   most detailed level, some are dominated by relatively young forests
   originating from fires dating back to the period centered on 1921. In
   others, forest stands are older (fires from the period centered on
   1851), some are under the influence of insect outbreaks and fires
   (southern part), while the rest are strongly affected by human
   activities and Populus tremuloides expansion. For all the study area and
   for parts of it, partitioning reveals that natural disturbance is the
   dominant data set explaining spatial variation in vegetation. However,
   the combination of natural disturbances, climate, physical environment
   and human disturbances always explains a high proportion of variation.
   Our approach, called ``ecological land classification of homogeneous
   vegetation landscapes{''}, is more comprehensive than previous ELCs in
   that it combines the concepts and goals of both landscape ecology and
   ecosystem-based management.},

   anthropogenic. We review the distribution and frequency of these major
   agents, along with their effects on connectivity and habitat quality.
   Most fragmentation research has focused on terrestrial habitats, but
   theories and generalizations developed in terrestrial habitats do not
   always apply well to river networks. For example, terrestrial habitats
   are usually conceptualized as two-dimensional, whereas rivers often are
   conceptualized as one-dimensional or dendritic. In addition, river flow
   often leads to highly asymmetric effects of barriers on habitat and
   permeability. New approaches tailored to river networks can be applied
   to describe the network-wide effects of multiple barriers on both
   connectivity and habitat quality. The net effects of anthropogenic
   fragmentation on freshwater biodiversity are likely underestimated,
   because of time lags in effects and the difficulty of generating a
   single, simple signal of fragmentation that applies to all aquatic
   species. We conclude by presenting a decision tree for managing
   freshwater fragmentation, as well as some research horizons for
   evaluating fragmented riverscapes.},

Abstract = {Telemetry, or the remote monitoring of animals with electronic
   transmitters and receivers, has vastly enhanced our ability to study
   aquatic animals. Radio telemetry, acoustic telemetry and passive
   integrated transponders are three common technologies that generate
   detection data - time-stamped, tag-specific records that are logged by
   receivers. We review current statistical methods and comment on
   potential future directions for analysing detection data derived from
   fixed telemetry receiver arrays. To illustrate how different methods may
   be used to achieve diverse study objectives, we provide a case study
   dataset collected by an array of 42 acoustic telemetry receivers on 187
   bull trout in the Kinbasket Reservoir of British Columbia. To close, we
   present a decision tree for guiding the selection of a method based on
   study objectives and sampling design. This paper provides both
   experienced and novice telemetry researchers with the knowledge and
   tools to facilitate more comprehensive analysis of detection data and,
   in so doing, ask a wide variety of ecological questions that will
   enhance our understanding of aquatic organisms.},

Abstract = {Regional conservation planning can often make more effective use of
   sparse biological data by linking these data to remotely mapped
   environmental variables through statistical modelling. While modelling
   distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely
   used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more
   information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or
   replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or
   assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to
   community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use
   planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia,
   and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these
   techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We
   also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness of
   community-level modelling by: ( 1) more closely integrating modelling
   with traditional ecological mapping ( e. g. vegetation mapping); ( 2)
   more tightly linking numerical classification and spatial modelling
   through application of canonical classification techniques; and ( 3)
   enhancing the applicability of modelling to data-poor regions through
   employment of a new technique for modelling spatial pattern in
   compositional dissimilarity.},

Abstract = {Landscape metrics are commonly used indicators of ecological pattern and
   processes in ecological modelling. Numerous landscape metrics are
   available, making the selection of appropriate metrics a common
   challenge in model development. In this paper, we tested the performance
   of methods for preselecting sets of three landscape metrics for use in
   modelling species richness of six groups of organisms (woody plants,
   orchids, orthopterans, amphibians, reptiles, and small terrestrial
   birds) and overall species richness in a Mediterranean forest landscape.
   The tested methods included expert knowledge, decision tree analysis,
   principal component analysis, and principal component regression. They
   were compared with random choice and optimal sets, which were evaluated
   by testing all possible combinations of metrics. All pre-selection
   methods performed significantly worse than the optimal sets. The
   statistical approaches performed slightly better than random choice that
   in turn performed slightly better than sets derived by expert knowledge.
   We concluded that the process of selecting the most appropriate
   landscape metrics for modelling biodiversity is not trivial and that
   shortcuts to systematic evaluation of metrics should not be expected to
   identify appropriate indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A decision-making tool for restoring lowland grasslands in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Species-rich grasslands suffer from significant loss and degradation all
   over the world. In particular in lowland Europe, the vast majority of
   these habitats are in an unfavourable conservation status which requires
   urgent restoration measures. A significant amount of information on the
   results of previous restorations exists thanks to the implementation of
   numerous projects and the publication of action plans, technical notes
   and scientific articles. This information is however very scattered,
   which does not facilitate the work of practitioners. We therefore
   propose here a decision support tool using a step-wise framework
   informed by the successes and failures obtained in two large-scale
   restoration projects supplemented by scientific and grey literature.
   This decision tree addresses different restoration techniques depending
   on the local context, e.g. the intensity of habitat degradation, the
   richness of soil nutrients, and the presence in the vicinity of a
   habitat in a good conservation status. Depending on the type of
   grassland, our tool then suggests various recurrent management
   techniques to be applied after restoration. This synthetic work is
   presented step by step according to a dichotomous key which is intended
   to help practitioners make the right choices in their restoration
   process.},

Abstract = {The impact of Land use/land cover (LULC) change was assessed through
   monitoring the distribution of ecological indicators and tracking the
   aeolian deposits, which provides valuable information on desertification
   and climate change in Tunisian arid regions. This study was conducted in
   Oum Zessar area, in southeastern Tunisia. Both visual interpretation and
   automated classification approach were developed to extract sand
   features using Landsat images for 2000, 2008 and 2014. The automated
   classification includes a decision tree classifier (DT) and an
   unsupervised classification applied to the principal components
   extracted from Knepper ratios composite. The validation of the
   classification methods showed that the DT had an overall accuracy over
   84\%. The results of the change detection have shown an increase in the
   classes of Agriculture behind tabia by 10.68\%, the rangelands and
   croplands by 24.37\% and the mountain rangelands by 14.93\%, and a
   decrease in the classes of Agriculture behind jessour by 33.65\%, sand
   encroachments by 12.93\% and halophyte rangelands by 3.4\%,
   respectively. These resulting maps seem to be the suitable
   decision-support tools for management of land use in arid regions of
   Tunisia, in particular, for land degradation assessment and water and
   soil conservation.},

Abstract = {The analysis of only single landscape attributes, like land use pattern,
   landscape elements, habitat structures, species and biocoenoses at
   different times is not sufficient to grasp the character of landscape
   change, especially with regard to the functional aspects. For this, the
   approach of land evaluation with the help of landscape functions and
   natural potentials is much more suitable. The assessment of landscape
   functions is also a supposition to formulate ecological targets of
   landscape development, on the conditions of landscape changes which
   continuously increase. The investigation took place within two rural
   test areas in the hilly zone of Saxony (Germany). At least twice (as a
   rule in the thirties and the eighties) the following landscape functions
   were assessed: biotic productivity, resistance of soils to water
   erosion, water retention capacity, recharge and protection of ground
   water, and potential for recreation within nature. The special
   methodologies (including advantages and shortcomings) are described, the
   past and present situations in the test areas are characterized, and the
   tendencies of the development are outlined. Additionally, an approach (a
   decision tree) for the elaboration of landscape-ecological targets and
   measures is presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is frequently used for marine mammals, and
   more recently it has also become popular for terrestrial species. Key
   advantages are the monitoring of (1) elusive species, (2) different taxa
   simultaneously, (3) large temporal and spatial scales, (4) with reduced
   human presence and (5) with considerable time saving for data
   processing. However, terrestrial sound environments can be highly
   complex; they are very challenging when trying to automatically detect
   and classify vocalizations because of low signal-to-noise ratios.
   Therefore, most studies have used manual preselection of high-quality
   sounds to achieve better classification rates. Consequently, most
   systems have never been validated under realistic field conditions.
   In this study, we evaluated the performance of a passive acoustic
   monitoring system for four primate species in the highly noisy rain
   forest environment of the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We collected
   12851h of recordings with 20 autonomous recording units and did not
   preselect high-quality sounds manually. To automatically detect and
   classify the sounds of interest, we used an automated system built on
   speaker segmentation, support vector machines and Gaussian mixture
   models. One hundred and seventy-nine hours of recordings were used for
   validating the system.
   The system performed well in detecting the loud calls of Cercopithecus
   diana and Colobus polykomos with a recall of 50\% and 42\%,
   respectively. Recall rates were lower for Pan troglodytes and Procolobus
   badius. To determine the presence of Cercopithecus diana and Colobus
   polykomos with a certainty of P>0999, 2 and 7h of recordings were
   needed, respectively. For these two species, our automated approach
   reflected the spatio-temporal distribution of vocalization events well.
   Despite the seemingly low precision, time investment for the manual
   removal of false positives in the system's output was only 35\% compared
   to a human collecting and processing the primate vocalization data.
   The proposed monitoring system is already fully applicable for
   Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos, whereas it needs further
   improvement for the other species tested. In principle, it can be
   applied to any distinctive animal sound and can be implemented for the
   collection of acoustic data for behavioural, ecological and conservation
   studies.},

Abstract = {Ecological knowledge has been characterised as incomplete, fuzzy,
   uncertain, sparse, empirical, and non-formalised. It is often expressed
   in qualitative terms, verbally or diagrammatically. There is a need for
   new and efficient computer-based tools for making this knowledge
   explicit, well organised, processable, and integrated with quantitative
   knowledge. Qualitative reasoning is an area of artificial intelligence
   that creates representations for continuous aspects of the world to
   support reasoning with little information. Particularly relevant for our
   work are qualitative representations of differential equations,
   (in-)equality reasoning and the explicit representation of causal
   relationships between quantities. We present qualitative models and
   simulations of population and community dynamics in the Brazilian
   Cerrado vegetation. The models are organised in clusters of predictive
   simulation models. The first cluster implements a general theory of
   population dynamics, with the explicit representation of processes such
   as natality, mortality immigration, emigration, colonisation, and
   population growth. These models are the basis for more complex community
   models. The second cluster represents interactions between two
   populations, such as symbiosis, competition, and predation. The third
   cluster represents the Cerrado succession hypothesis, a commonsense
   theory of succession in the Cerrado vegetation. It is assumed that fire
   frequency influences a number of environmental factors. When fire
   frequency increases succession leads to open grasslands and when fire
   frequency decreases the vegetation becomes woody and denser. This
   article shows the potential of qualitative reasoning for ecological
   modelling, particularly for answering questions of interest and making
   scientifically valid predictions using only qualitative terms.},

Pages = {165-201},

Abstract = {Because of the frequent inefficiency of classical mathematical modelling
   to help the human operators in the supervision of biological processes,
   we present here a method based on qualitative reasoning concepts for
   simulating the interpretation of measurements, analyses, and
   observations, commonly done on aquatic ecosystems for management
   purposes. Once the domain variables are identified, their cause-effect
   dependences are represented as a directed graph. Each variable takes its
   value in a five-symbol set called quantity space (QS). These symbols
   \{pp, p, m, f, ff\}, correspond to expert qualifiers, like respectively:
   very low, low, medium, high, very high. A synthetic formalism is
   proposed to encode four types of knowledge rules: (1) translation of the
   numerical input values (i.e. measurements and results of analyses) into
   qualitative values; (2) translation of the linguistic observations into
   qualitative values; (3) formal calculus on QS, using six empirically
   defined operators, for propagating a top-down form of reasoning
   throughout the causal network, enabling the determination of the
   qualitative values of unmeasured variables from the values of their
   causes; (4) control of the execution of the reasoning. The software
   prototype, implemented in Prolog, has four main functions: short-term
   prediction of management parameters, causal explanation of the
   reasoning, state memorization, and choice of control variables in the
   causal network. These capabilities are illustrated by examples from an
   application enabling the interpretation of data in hydroecology. The
   relevance of a qualitative reasoning approach is emphasized,
   particularly for making empirical knowledge, typical of biological
   process control, operational.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {323-328},
Abstract = {Rangeland degradation continues in Australia, China and elsewhere. The
   stocking rate/animal production relationship has been a successful
   concept for pastoralists wanting to avoid degradation and/or raise
   incomes. However, there are no means available of alerting pastoralists
   to the approach of critical thresholds that would `flip' rangelands into
   alternative states when grazing-stressed. Critical threshold forecasting
   for avoiding degradation (and seizing restoration opportunities) could
   be made available online. Research has yet to find, assemble and test
   the set of indicators needed to forecast the approach of critical
   thresholds envisaged in State-and-Transition thinking. Forecasting at
   paddock, property and regional scales would have to involve
   high-performance computing because the thresholds will be space and time
   dependent. The case for Australia and China to contribute cooperatively
   to this research effort rests on the large number of contrasting
   rangeland ecosystems across the two countries that represent rangelands
   globally. A proven history of past collaboration is extant with existing
   research programs on plant population dynamics, landscape
   patchiness/leakiness and soil biota status, and their responses to the
   separate and combined effects of climate and grazing animals. The road
   to adoption would involve partnerships with pastoralists throughout the
   process, remote sensing to identify approaching thresholds in real time,
   application of high-performance computing and possibly artificial
   intelligence, and packaging of forecasts for different socio-economic
   rangeland systems.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal modelling is an important task for ecology. Social media
   tags have been found to have great potential to assist in predicting
   aspects of the natural environment, particularly through the use of
   machine learning methods. Here we propose a novel spatiotemporal
   embeddings model, called SPATE, which is able to integrate textual
   information from the photo-sharing platform Flickr and structured
   scientific information from more traditional environmental data sources.
   The proposed model can be used for modelling and predicting a wide
   variety of ecological features such as species distribution, as well as
   related phenomena such as climate features. We first propose a new
   method based on spatiotemporal kernel density estimation to handle the
   sparsity of Flickr tag distributions over space and time. Then, we
   efficiently integrate the spatially and temporally smoothed Flickr tags
   with the structured scientific data into low-dimensional vector space
   representations. We experimentally show that our model is able to
   substantially outperform baselines that rely only on Flickr or only on
   traditional sources.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Scientists investigate the dynamics of complex systems with quantitative
   models, employing them to synthesize knowledge, to explain obervations,
   and to forecast future system behavior. Complete specification of
   systems is impossible, so models must be simplified abstractions. Thus,
   the art of modeling involves deciding which system elements to include
   and determining how they should be represented. We view modeling as
   search through a space of candidate models that is guided by model
   objectives, theoretical knowledge, and empirical data. In this
   contribution, we introduce a method for representing process-based
   models that facilitates the discovery of structures that explain
   observed behavior. This representation casts dynamic systems as
   interacting sets of processes that act on entities. Using this approach,
   a modeler first encodes relevant ecological knowledge into a library of
   generic entities and processes, then instantiates these theoretical
   components, and finally assembles candidate models from these elements.
   We illustrate this methodology with a model of the Ross Sea ecosystem.

Abstract = {Ecologists have long sought to understand the dynamics of populations
   and communities by deriving mathematical theory from first principles.
   Theoretical models often take the form of dynamical equations that
   comprise the ecological processes (e.g. competition, predation) believed
   to govern system dynamics. The inverse of this approach-inferring which
   processes and ecological interactions drive observed dynamics-remains an
   open problem in ecology. Here, we propose a way to attack this problem
   using a machine learning method known as symbolic regression, which
   seeks to discover relationships in time-series data and to express those
   relationships using dynamical equations. We found that this method could
   rapidly discover models that explained most of the variance in three
   classic demographic time series. More importantly, it reverse:
   engineered the models previously proposed by theoretical ecologists to
   describe these time series, capturing the core ecological processes
   these models describe and their functional forms. Our findings suggest a
   potentially powerful new way to merge theory development and data
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Bacteria and archaea are locked in a near-constant battle with their
   viral pathogens. Despite previous mechanistic characterization of
   numerous prokaryotic defense strategies, the underlying ecological
   drivers of different strategies remain largely unknown and predicting
   which species will take which strategies remains a challenge. Here, we
   focus on the CRISPR immune strategy and develop a
   phylogenetically-corrected machine learning approach to build a
   predictive model of CRISPR incidence using data on over 100 traits
   across over 2600 species. We discover a strong but hitherto-unknown
   negative interaction between CRISPR and aerobicity, which we hypothesize
   may result from interference between CRISPR-associated proteins and
   non-homologous end-joining DNA repair due to oxidative stress. Our
   predictive model also quantitatively confirms previous observations of
   an association between CRISPR and temperature. Finally, we contrast the
   environmental associations of different CRISPR system types (I, II, III)
   and restriction modification systems, all of which act as intracellular
   immune systems.},

Abstract = {Coexistence and food web theory are two cornerstones of the
   long-standing effort to understand how species coexist. Although
   competition and predation are known to act simultaneously in
   communities, theory and empirical study of these processes continue to
   be developed largely independently. Here, we integrate modern
   coexistence theory and food web theory to simultaneously quantify the
   relative importance of predation and environmental fluctuations for
   species coexistence. We first examine coexistence in a theoretical,
   multitrophic model, adding complexity to the food web using machine
   learning approaches. We then apply our framework to a stochastic model
   of the rocky intertidal food web, partitioning empirical coexistence
   dynamics. We find the main effects of both environmental fluctuations
   and variation in predator abundances contribute substantially to species
   coexistence. Unexpectedly, their interaction tends to destabilise
   coexistence, leading to new insights about the role of bottom-up vs.
   top-down forces in both theory and the rocky intertidal ecosystem.},

Title = {How index selection, compression, and recording schedule impact the

Abstract = {Acoustic indices derived from environmental soundscape recordings are
   being used to monitor ecosystem health and vocal animal biodiversity.
   Soundscape data can quickly become very expensive and difficult to
   manage, so data compression or temporal down-sampling are sometimes
   employed to reduce data storage and transmission costs. These parameters
   vary widely between experiments, with the consequences of this variation
   remaining mostly unknown. We analyse field recordings from North-Eastern
   Borneo across a gradient of historical land use. We quantify the impact
   of experimental parameters (MP3 compression, recording length and
   temporal subsetting) on soundscape descriptors (Analytical Indices and a
   convolutional neural net derived AudioSet Fingerprint). Both descriptor
   types were tested for their robustness to parameter alteration and their
   usability in a soundscape classification task. We find that compression
   and recording length both drive considerable variation in calculated
   index values. However, we find that the effects of this variation and
   temporal subsetting on the performance of classification models is
   minor: performance is much more strongly determined by acoustic index
   choice, with Audioset fingerprinting offering substantially greater
   (12\%-16\%) levels of classifier accuracy, precision and recall. We
   advise using the AudioSet Fingerprint in soundscape analysis, finding
   superior and consistent performance even on small pools of data. If data
   storage is a bottleneck to a study, we recommend Variable Bit Rate
   encoded compression (quality = 0) to reduce file size to 23\% file size
   without affecting most Analytical Index values. The AudioSet Fingerprint
   can be compressed further to a Constant Bit Rate encoding of 64 kb/s
   (8\% file size) without any detectable effect. These recommendations
   allow the efficient use of restricted data storage whilst permitting
   comparability of results between different studies.},

Title = {LANDFIRE Remap Prototype Mapping Effort: Developing a New Framework for
   Mapping Vegetation Classification, Change, and Structure},
Journal = {FIRE-SWITZERLAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {LANDFIRE (LF) National (2001) was the original product suite of the
   LANDFIRE program, which included Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC), Height
   (EVH), and Type (EVT). Subsequent refinements after feedback from data
   users resulted in updated products, referred to as LF 2001, that now
   served as LANDFIRE's baseline datasets and are the basis for all
   subsequent LANDFIRE updates. These updates account for disturbances and
   vegetation transition changes that may not represent current vegetation
   conditions. Therefore, in 2016 LANDFIRE initiated the Remap prototype to
   determine how to undertake a national-scale remap of the LANDFIRE
   primary vegetation datasets. EVC, EVH, and EVT were produced (circa
   2015) via modeling for ecologically variable prototyping areas in the
   Pacific Northwest (NW) and Grand Canyon (GC). An error analysis within
   the GC suggested an overall accuracy of 52\% (N = 800) for EVT, and a
   goodness of fit of 51\% (N = 38) for percent cover (continuous EVC) and
   53\% (N = 38) for height (continuous EVH). The prototyping effort
   included a new 81-class map using the National Vegetation Classification
   (NVC) within the NW. This paper presents a narrative of the innovative
   methodologies in image processing and mapping used to create the new
   LANDFIRE vegetation products.},

Abstract = {To determine whether American martens Martes americana behaviourally
   thermoregulate late in winter, and to estimate the energetic cost of
   resting in various forest microhabitats , we studied microenvironments
   used by martens in a coniferous forest in the Medicine Bow Mountains,
   Wyoming. We hypothesized that martens would rest in sites that minimized
   energetic costs, and that the relative thermal efficiency of sites would
   vary as a function of snow depth and weather. By measuring heat loss
   from a heated model and calculating operative temperature, we found that
   equivalent marten metabolic rates were inversely related to operative
   temperatures. Operative temperatures were generally higher outside
   resting cavities than inside, except when snow was >15 cm, outside air
   temperature was less than or equal to-5 degrees C, and wind was greater
   than or equal to 0.3 m s(-1). For the models lying on a snowy substrate,
   total body conductance was 0.32 W degrees C-1, 23\% higher than with the
   models lying on dry wood chips. The microenvironments of resting sites
   and the preferences of martens generally are consistent with our
   hypothesis of behavioural thermoregulation. Conductance contributed
   strongly to total thermal losses and to explaining selection of resting
   sites. We propose a decision tree to predict where American martens
   should rest under a range of environmental conditions.},

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {194},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {27-40},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Insect colours assist in body protection, signalling, and physiological
   adaptations. Colours also convey multiple channels of information. These
   channels are valuable for species identification, distinguishing
   individual quality, and revealing ecological or evolutionary aspects of
   animals' life. During recent years, the emerging interest in colour
   research has been raised in social hymenopterans such as ants, wasps,
   and bees. These insects provide important ecosystem services and many of
   those are model research organisms. Here we review benefits that various
   colour types give to social insects, summarize practical applications,
   and highlight further directions. Ants might use colours principally for
   camouflage, however the evolutionary function of colour in ants needs
   more attention; in case of melanin colouration there is evidence for its
   interrelation with thermoregulation and pathogen resistance. Colours in
   wasps and bees have confirmed linkages to thermoregulation, which is
   increasingly important in face of global climate change. Besides wasps
   use colours for various types of signalling. Colour variations of well
   chemically defended social insects are the mimetic model for unprotected
   organisms. Despite recent progress in molecular identification of
   species, colour variations are still widely in use for species
   identification. Therefore, further studies on variability is encouraged.
   Being closely interconnected with physiological and biochemical
   processes, insect colouration is a great source for finding new
   ecological indicators and biomarkers. Due to novel digital imaging
   techniques, software, and artificial intelligence there are emerging
   possibilities for new advances in this topic. Further colour research in
   social insects should consider specific features of sociality.},

Title = {Precision restoration: a necessary approach to foster forest recovery in
   the 21st century},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Forest restoration is currently a primary objective in environmental
   management policies at a global scale, to the extent that impressive
   initiatives and commitments have been launched to plant billions of
   trees. However, resources are limited and the success of any restoration
   effort should be maximized. Thus, restoration programs should seek to
   guarantee that what is planted today will become an adult tree in the
   future, a simple fact that, however, usually receives little attention.
   Here, we advocate for the need to focus restoration efforts on an
   individual plant level to increase establishment success while reducing
   negative side effects by using an approach that we term ``precision
   forest restoration{''} (PFR). The objective of PFR will be to ensure
   that planted seedlings or sowed seeds will become adult trees with the
   appropriate landscape configuration to create functional and
   self-regulating forest ecosystems while reducing the negative impacts of
   traditional massive reforestation actions. PFR can take advantage of
   ecological knowledge together with technologies and methodologies from
   the landscape scale to the individual-plant scale, and from the more
   traditional, low-tech approaches to the latest high-tech ones. PFR may
   be more expensive at the level of individual plants, but will be more
   cost-effective in the long term if it allows for the creation of
   resilient forests able to provide multiple ecosystem services. PFR was
   not feasible a few years ago due to the high cost and low precision of
   the available technologies, but it is currently an alternative that
   might reformulate a wide spectrum of ecosystem restoration activities.},

Abstract = {Practicing ecologists who excel at their work ({''}experts'') hold a
   wealth of knowledge. This knowledge offers a wide range of opportunities
   for application in ecological research and natural resource
   decision-making. While experts are often consulted ad-hoc, their
   contributions are not widely acknowledged. These informal applications
   of expert knowledge lead to concerns about a lack of transparency and
   repeatability, causing distrust of this knowledge source in the
   scientific community. Here, we address these concerns with an
   exploration of the diversity of expert knowledge and of rigorous methods
   in its use. The effective use of expert knowledge hinges on an awareness
   of the spectrum of experts and their expertise, which varies by breadth
   of perspective and critical assessment. Also, experts express their
   knowledge in different forms depending on the degree of
   contextualization with other information. Careful matching of experts to
   application is therefore essential and has to go beyond a simple fitting
   of the expert to the knowledge domain. The standards for the collection
   and use of expert knowledge should be as rigorous as for empirical data.
   This involves knowing when it is appropriate to use expert knowledge and
   how to identify and select suitable experts. Further, it requires a
   careful plan for the collection, analysis and validation of the
   knowledge. The knowledge held by expert practitioners is too valuable to
   be ignored. But only when thorough methods are applied, can the
   application of expert knowledge be as valid as the use of empirical
   data. The responsibility for the effective and rigorous use of expert
   knowledge lies with the researchers.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a review of the development and use of multi-agent
   simulations (MAS) for ecosystem management. The use of this methodology
   and the associated tools accompanies the shifts in various paradigms on
   the study of ecological complexity. Behavior and interactions are now
   key issues for understanding and modeling ecosystem organization, and
   models are used in a constructivist way. MAS are introduced conceptually
   and are compared with individual-based modeling approaches. Various
   architectures of agents are presented, the role of the environment is
   emphasized and some computer tools are presented. A discussion follows
   on the use of MAS for ecosystem management. The strength of MAS has been
   discussed for social sciences and for spatial issues such as land-use
   change. We argue here that MAS are useful for problems integrating
   social and spatial aspects. Then we discuss how MAS can be used for
   several purposes, from theorization to collective decision-making
   support. We propose some research perspectives on individual decision
   making processes, institutions, scales, the credibility of models and
   the use of MAS. In conclusion we argue that researchers in the field of
   ecosystem management can use multi-agent systems to go beyond the role
   of the individual and to study more deeply and more effectively the
   different forms of organization (spatial, networks, hierarchies) and
   interactions among different organizational levels. For that objective
   there is considerably more fruit to be had on the tree of collaboration
   between social, ecological, and computer scientists than has so far been
   harvested. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We currently face significant, anthropogenic, global environmental
   challenges and the role of ecologists in mitigating these challenges is
   arguably more important than ever. Consequently there is an urgent need
   to recruit and train future generations of ecologists, both those whose
   main area is ecology, but also those involved in the geological,
   biological and environmental sciences. Here we present the results of a
   horizon scanning exercise that identified current and future challenges
   facing the teaching of ecology, through surveys of teachers, students
   and employers of ecologists. Key challenges identified were grouped in
   terms of the perspectives of three groups: students, for example the
   increasing disconnect between people and nature; teachers, for example
   the challenges associated with teaching the quantitative skills that are
   inherent to the study of ecology; and society, for example poor societal
   perceptions of the field of ecology. In addition to the challenges
   identified, we propose a number of solutions developed at a workshop by
   a team of ecology teaching experts, with supporting evidence of their
   potential to address many of the problems raised. These proposed
   solutions include developing living labs, teaching students to be
   ecological entrepreneurs and influencers, embedding skills-based
   learning and coding in the curriculum, an increased role for learned
   societies in teaching and learning, and using new technology to enhance
   fieldwork studies including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and
   real-time spoken language translation. Our findings are focused towards
   UK higher education, but they should be informative for students and
   teachers of a wide range of educational levels, policy makers and
   professional ecologists worldwide.},

Abstract = {Many types of ecological or environmental problems would benefit from
   models based on people's knowledge. To create ecological models with
   both expert and local people's knowledge, a multi-step fuzzy cognitive
   mapping approach is proposed. A cognitive map can be made of almost any
   system or problem. Cognitive maps are qualitative models of a system,
   consisting of variables and the causal relationships between those
   variables. We describe how our cognitive mapping research has been used
   in real environmental management applications. This research includes
   examining the perceptions of different stakeholders in an environmental
   conflict, obtaining the perceptions of different stakeholders to
   facilitate the development of participatory environmental management
   plans, and determining the wants and desires for resettlement of people
   displaced by a large scale dam project. Based on our research, which
   involved six separate studies, we have found that interviewees complete
   their cognitive maps in 40-90 min on average. These maps contain an
   average of 23 +/- 2 S.D. variables with 37 +/- 3 S.D. connections.
   People generally put more forcing functions into their maps than utility
   variables. Fuzzy cognitive mapping offers many advantages for ecological
   modeling including the ability to include abstract and aggregate
   variables in models, the ability to model relationships which are not
   known with certainty, the ability to model complex relationships which
   are full of feedback loops, and the ease and speed of obtaining and
   combining different knowledge sources and of running different policy
   options. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The development of new methods and approaches for ensuring the
   sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services is an important
   challenge that ecologists, agronomists, and theoreticians must address
   together. Enhancement of ecosystem services needs to be addressed at
   different scales and should include the interaction between farmland
   biodiversity and stakeholders (farmers, managers, policy makers, etc.)
   to optimize service delivery. Predictions require an understanding of
   the interactions between numerous management options and components of
   biodiversity. Here, we argue that interaction networks on a broad sense
   (from food webs to landscapes networks in which nodes could be species,
   trophic groups, fields or farms) can help address this high level of
   complexity. We examine how tools from mathematics and artificial
   intelligence, developed for network modelling and reasoning, could be
   useful for assessing and enhancing ecosystems services. In doing this we
   highlight the gaps that currently exist between our questions about
   ecosystem service provision and our ability to answer them with current
   modelling approaches. We illustrate the use of these tools with three
   case studies related to `pest regulation services'. These include food
   web approaches to assess animal pest regulation services and decisional
   models to address management strategies for diseases and weeds. Finally,
   we describe how different types of network models might operate at
   different scales of management. The future challenge for agroecologists
   will be to produce models of interactions and emergent ecosystem
   services, which are sufficiently quantified and validated. We suggest
   that network ecology is a nascent research topic that is developing a
   strong and unified empirical and theoretical foundation, which could
   serve as the central paradigm for a sustainable, intensive agriculture
   in the future.},

Title = {Biological traits approaches in benthic marine ecology: Dead ends and
   new paths},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Biological traits analysis (BTA) links community structure to both
   ecological functions and response to environmental drivers through
   species' attributes. In consequence, it has become a popular approach in
   marine benthic studies. However, BTA will reach a dead end if the
   scientific community does not acknowledge its current shortcomings and
   limitations: (a) uncertainties related to data origins and a lack of
   standardized reporting of trait information; (b) knowledge gaps on the
   role of multiple interacting traits on driving the organisms' responses
   to environmental variability; (c) knowledge gaps regarding the
   mechanistic links between traits and functions; (d) a weak focus on the
   spatial and temporal variability that is inherent to the trait
   expression of species; and, last but not least, (e) the large reliance
   on expert knowledge due to an enormous knowledge gap on the basic
   ecology of many benthic species. BTA will only reach its full potential
   if the scientific community is able to standardize and unify the
   reporting and storage of traits data and reconsider the importance of
   baseline observational and experimental studies to fill knowledge gaps
   on the mechanistic links between biological traits, functions, and
   environmental variability. This challenge could be assisted by embracing
   new technological advances in marine monitoring, such as underwater
   camera technology and artificial intelligence, and making use of
   advanced statistical approaches that consider the interactive nature and
   spatio-temporal variability of biological systems. The scientific
   community has to abandon some dead ends and explore new paths that will
   improve our understanding of individual species, traits, and the
   functioning of benthic ecosystems.},

Number = {5-6, SI},
Pages = {358-366},

Abstract = {Ecologists and decision makers need ways to understand systems, test
   ideas, and make predictions and explanations about systems. However,
   uncertainty about causes and effects of processes and parameter values
   is pervasive in models of ecological systems. Uncertainty associated
   with incomplete knowledge of a phenomenon-and incomplete knowledge of
   the limits of one's knowledge-is referred to as epistemic uncertainty.
   Here, we illustrate the use of qualitative reasoning (QR) as a modeling
   approach that supports simulation despite pervasive epistemic
   uncertainty in a system. We develop a QR model of a simple
   plant-resource system to illustrate how six sources of epistemic
   uncertainty can be expressed, assessed, and managed. These include
   uncertainty about system structure, quantity vagueness, functional
   relationships, unknown or exogenous processes, simulation outcomes, and
   post-diction or explanation of outcomes. We show that QR provides a
   useful framework for expressing uncertainty due to inexact knowledge
   about parameter values and for exploring the consequences of different
   understandings of system structure. Furthermore, uncertainty in
   parameter values can be expressed and managed using different
   representations of and constraints on parameter quantity spaces.
   Compositional modeling supports the creation of alternative models
   representing different system structures. QR models allow the creation
   of a full envisionment of all possible outcomes given a set of causal
   processes, a particular system structure, and starting values. Finally,
   explicit representation of system structure and causality allows
   simulation results to be unambiguously explained. These features of QR
   support ecologists in making explicit their substantial qualitative
   knowledge about causes and effects in systems to produce models that
   give rise to insightful simulations of system dynamics. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to provide a holistic framework to
   delineate ``territories of opportunity{''} where agrarian communities
   can manage areas to enhance the conservation of large vertebrates. The
   study was conducted Mexico, which is sociologically, culturally and
   ecologically complex, similar to other ``megadiverse{''} countries. We
   conducted ensemble niche modeling of endangered top predators to define
   a set of large vertebrate species. Environmental attributes were used to
   perform three distance-based and two artificial intelligence-based
   algorithms. Socio-cultural attributes were included to depict
   agricultural communities with strong social government schemes and clear
   evidence of well-managed natural resources. Other socio-economic
   attributes such as land acquisition cost, human agglomeration and
   anthropogenic land use were included in the analysis. Scenarios were
   computed and displayed cartographically with the aid of a geographic
   information system. Results showed that the largest concentration of
   biodiversity converges on regions with large land cover persistence and
   high local governance, defined as potential willingness to engage in
   conservation actions. The cartographic areas identified overlapped with
   current Mexican protected areas in only 2.7\% of the country. Thus,
   conservation law enforcement in most of the country seems to be
   ineffective. Here we show that, in a number of territories, agrarian
   communities that have coexisted for millennia with umbrella species can
   be regarded as allies in biodiversity conservation. Results are
   discussed in the light of their relevance for future niche modeling,
   environmental policy design and implications for climate change.},

Title = {Data selection in frog chorusing recognition with acoustic indices},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This research explores the data selection problem in acoustic
   recognition of two co-existing sibling frog species from long-duration
   field recordings. This study explores the data selection problem in
   species recognition with machine learning, including instance selection
   and acoustic index feature selection. Our target species are two
   co-existing frog species. The Wallum Sedgefrog (Litoria olongburensis)
   is the most threatened acid frog species, facing habitat loss and
   degradation across much of their distribution, in addition to further
   pressures associated with anecdotally-recognised competition from it's
   sibling species, the Eastern Sedgefrog (Litoria fallax). Monitoring the
   calling behaviours of these two species is essential for informing L.
   olongburensis management and protection, and for obtaining ecological
   information about the process and implications of their competition. In
   order to recognise them from recordings, automated recognisers, instead
   of manual surveys, are required due to the overwhelmingly large volume
   of acoustic data. However, it costs much time and effort to annotate
   acoustic data, which results in a lack of labelled data for training
   recognisers. In addition, the composition of field audio recordings is
   complex and varies according to weather conditions, seasonal changes and
   animal activities. In this case, the chorusing behaviours of these two
   frog species can be greatly affected by weather conditions, for example,
   rains. Since we can only select limited amount of data from a very
   diverse data pool to annotate, it is important to explore how the
   selection of instances and features affects the performance of
   recognisers. In this paper, we selected two 24-h audio datasets from
   different weather conditions as our dataset. We first give a detailed
   visual comparison of them with false-colour spectrograms. Then we use
   datasets from individual days, their combination and a synthetic set
   constructed from them to evaluate the impact of different training
   instances on the recognition performance. We also analyses the
   effectiveness of acoustic index features. The experimental results show
   that models trained on data of a vocalisation-intense day or a normal
   day do not work well on each other. However, extra data from a
   normal-day dataset does help the recognition on a vocalisation-intense
   day, especially when the composition of the training set is consistent
   with the real-life weather condition ratio. Generally, including more
   data in training set is helpful, but limiting vocalisation-intense data
   as their ratio in real life help optimise the performance of
   recognisers. As for the selection of acoustic index features, a good
   recognition performance on different chorusing behaviours requires
   different sets of features.},

Abstract = {Ecology and evolutionary biology, like other scientific fields, are
   experiencing an exponential growth of academic manuscripts. As domain
   knowledge accumulates, scientists will need new computational approaches
   for identifying relevant literature to read and include in formal
   literature reviews and meta-analyses. Importantly, these approaches can
   also facilitate automated, large-scale data synthesis tasks and build
   structured databases from the information in the texts of primary
   journal articles, books, grey literature, and websites. The increasing
   availability of digital text, computational resources, and
   machine-learning based language models have led to a revolution in text
   analysis and natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. NLP has
   been widely adopted across the biomedical sciences but is rarely used in
   ecology and evolutionary biology. Applying computational tools from text
   mining and NLP will increase the efficiency of data synthesis, improve
   the reproducibility of literature reviews, formalize analyses of
   research biases and knowledge gaps, and promote data-driven discovery of
   patterns across ecology and evolutionary biology. Here we present recent
   use cases from ecology and evolution, and discuss future applications,

Abstract = {Supervised learning of behavioural modes from body acceleration data has
   become a widely used research tool in Behavioural Ecology over the past
   decade. One of the primary usages of this tool is to estimate
   behavioural time budgets from the distribution of behaviours as
   predicted by the model. These serve as the key parameters to test
   predictions about the variation in animal behaviour. In this paper we
   show that the widespread computation of behavioural time budgets is
   biased, due to ignoring the classification model confusion
   probabilities. Next, we introduce the confusion matrix correction for
   time budgets-a simple correction method for adjusting the computed time
   budgets based on the model's confusion matrix. Finally, we show that the
   proposed correction is able to eliminate the bias, both theoretically
   and empirically in a series of data simulations on body acceleration
   data of a fossorial rodent species (Damaraland mole-rat Fukomys
   damarensis). Our paper provides a simple implementation of the confusion
   matrix correction for time budgets, and we encourage researchers to use
   it to improve accuracy of behavioural time budget calculations.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs worldwide face unprecedented cumulative anthropogenic
   effects of interacting local human pressures, global climate change and
   distal social processes. Reefs are also bound by the natural biophysical
   environment within which they exist. In this context, a key challenge
   for effective management is understanding how anthropogenic and
   biophysical conditions interact to drive distinct coral reef
   configurations. Here, we use machine learning to conduct explanatory
   predictions on reef ecosystems defined by both fish and benthic
   communities. Drawing on the most spatially extensive dataset available
   across the Hawaiian archipelago-20 anthropogenic and biophysical
   predictors over 620 survey sites-we model the occurrence of four
   distinct reef regimes and provide a novel approach to quantify the
   relative influence of human and environmental variables in shaping reef
   ecosystems. Our findings highlight the nuances of what underpins
   different coral reef regimes, the overwhelming importance of biophysical
   predictors and how a reef's natural setting may either expand or narrow
   the opportunity space for management interventions. The methods
   developed through this study can help inform reef practitioners and hold
   promises for replication across a broad range of ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions exert multiple pervasive effects on ecosystems,
   potentially disrupting species interactions and global ecological
   processes. Our ability to successfully predict and manage the
   ecosystem-level impacts of biological invasions is strongly dependent on
   our capacity to empirically characterize complex biological interactions
   and their spatiotemporal dynamics. In this chapter, we argue that the
   comprehensive integration of multiple complementary tools within the
   explicit context of ecological networks is essential for providing
   mechanistic insight into invasion processes and their impact across
   organizational levels. We provide an overview of traditional (stable
   isotopes, populations genetics) and emerging (metabarcoding, citizen
   science) techniques and methods, and their practical implementation in
   the context of biological invasions. We also present several currently
   available models and machine-learning approaches that could be used for
   predicting novel or undocumented interactions, thus allowing a more
   robust and cost-effective forecast of network and ecosystem stability.
   Finally, we discuss the importance of methodological advancements on the
   emergence of scientific and societal challenges for investigating local
   and global species histories with several skill sets.},

Abstract = {Anthrax is a potentially life-threatening bacterial disease that can
   spread between wild and livestock animals and humans. Transmission
   typically occurs indirectly via environmental exposure, with devastating
   consequences for human and animal health, as well as pastoralist
   economies. India has a high annual occurrence of anthrax in some
   regions, but a country-wide delineation of risk has not yet been
   undertaken. The current study modelled the geographical suitability of
   anthrax across India and its associated environmental features using a
   biogeographic application of machine learning. Both biotic and abiotic
   features contributed to risk across multiple scales of influence. The
   elephant-livestock interface was the dominant feature in delineating
   anthrax suitability. In addition, water-soil balance, soil chemistry and
   historical forest loss were also influential. These findings suggest
   that the elephant-livestock interface plays an important role in the
   cycling of anthrax in India. Livestock prevention efforts targeting this
   interface, particularly within anthropogenic ecotones, may yield
   successes in reducing ongoing transmission between animal hosts and
   subsequent zoonotic transmission to humans.},

Abstract = {With many of the world's migratory bird populations in alarming decline,
   broad-scale assessments of responses to migratory hazards may prove
   crucial to successful conservation efforts. Most birds migrate at night
   through increasingly light-polluted skies. Bright light sources can
   attract airborne migrants and lead to collisions with structures, but
   might also influence selection of migratory stopover habitat and thereby
   acquisition of food resources. We demonstrate, using multi-year weather
   radar measurements of nocturnal migrants across the northeastern U.S.,
   that autumnal migrant stopover density increased at regional scales with
   proximity to the brightest areas, but decreased within a few kilometers
   of brightly-lit sources. This finding implies broad-scale attraction to
   artificial light while airborne, impeding selection for extensive forest
   habitat. Given that high-quality stopover habitat is critical to
   successful migration, and hindrances during migration can decrease
   fitness, artificial lights present a potentially heightened conservation
   concern for migratory bird populations.},

Title = {Progress in the remote sensing of veld fire occurrence and detection: A
   review},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Our research provides a detailed overview of the progress in remotely
   sensed fire monitoring techniques, which have been developed and
   employed for fire occurrence and detection. Our overview is provided
   from a literature search of English-peer reviewed articles, conference
   proceedings and scientific book sections published between the periods
   of 1980 and 2019. Literature reveals that historically, fire detection
   through remotely sensed techniques has mainly occurred through
   ground-based, airborne and satellite systems. Mathematical models, such
   as decision tree models, Species Distribution Models, Dynamic Global
   Vegetation Models and Global Climate Models, have also been employed
   alongside satellite systems to facilitate a greater understanding of
   fire dynamics and its susceptibility to changes in ecological and
   climatic variables. Fire frequency and severity are known to be
   influenced by atmospheric conditions, fuel load and ignitions. However,
   the literature suggests that targeting inappropriate wildfires with
   these techniques may still result in wildfires outside of the natural
   fire regime. Most studies regarding fire occurrence and/or monitoring
   focus on satellite-based techniques as they provide the greatest
   coverage of wildfires at varying spatial and temporal resolutions
   depending on the sensor used. Satellite systems are advantageous for
   fire monitoring as they provide extensive coverage inexpensively.
   Finally, fire occurrence is explicitly influenced by moisture-limited
   climatic conditions and/or fuel load in the form of leaf-litter or
   water-stressed plants.},

Title = {Estimating non-native plant richness with a species-accumulation model
   along roads},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Monitoring non-native plant richness is important for biodiversity
   conservation and scientific research. The species-area model (SA model)
   has been used frequently to estimate the total species richness within a
   region. However, the conventional SA model may not provide robust
   estimations of non-native plant richness because the ecological
   processes associated with the accumulation of exotic and native plants
   may differ. Because roads strongly dictate the distributions of exotic
   plants, we propose a species-accumulation model along roads (SR model),
   rather than an SA model, to estimate the non-native plant richness
   within a region. Using 270 simulated data sets, we compared the
   differences in performance between the SR and SA models. A decision tree
   based on prediction accuracy was created to guide model application,
   which was validated using field data from 3 national nature reserves in
   3 different provinces in China. The SR model significantly outperformed
   the SA model when non-native species were restricted to the roadsides
   and the proportion of uncommon exotic species was small. More
   importantly, the SR model accurately estimated the non-native plant
   richness in all field sites with an error of <1 species per site. We

Abstract = {Environmental factors which influence the distributions of malaria
   vectors in northern Australia (Anopheles farauti ss, A. farauti 2 and A.
   farauti 3) were investigated by ecological niche modelling and data
   mining using an extensive data set of species presence and absence
   records obtained by systematic field surveys. Models were generated with
   GARP (the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction) using geographical
   coverages of 41 climatic and topographic parameters for the north of the
   continent. Environmental variables associated with species records were
   identified with the ranking procedures of the decision tree software
   packages CART and KnowledgeSeeker. There was consistent agreement in the
   variables ranked by both methods. This permitted the selection of
   reduced sets of environmental variables to develop GARP models for the
   three target species with equivalent predictive accuracy to those which
   used all of the environmental information. The environmental parameters
   which define the realised distributions of A. farauti ss and A. farauti
   3 were well described by this approach but the results were less
   satisfactory for A. farauti 2. Atmospheric moisture was shown to be a
   critical variable for each species which accords with many field and
   laboratory observations concerning the influence of humidity on adult
   mosquito survival. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ecologists, outdoor professionals and the public work and play in lands
   with complex histories. Part of decolonizing our professional and
   recreational practices is to expose settler colonial biases and
   recognize the histories of colonized lands and the peoples who have
   stewarded these lands for millennia prior to colonization. To provide a
   quantitative example of settler colonial biases in a familiar context,
   we examined the origins of over 2,200 place names in 16 national parks
   in the United States (US; 26\% of the parks). Through iterative thematic
   analysis of place name origins and meanings, we constructed a decision
   tree for classifying place names according to emergent categories, which
   enabled the quantification and spatial analysis of place name meanings.
   All national parks examined have place names that tacitly endorse racist
   or, more specifically, anti-Indigenous ideologies, thus perpetuating
   settler colonialism and white supremacy at the system scale for future
   generations. Looking east to west across the US, the proportion of place
   names per national park that appropriated Indigenous names increased in
   parallel with the westward expansion and evolution of US settler
   colonialism. This examination of place names, name origins and their
   consequences is an opportunity to make everyday complicity in systemic
   oppression more visible and to more actively advance decolonizing
   practices for land and language. Read the free Plain Language Summary

Abstract = {Aim Intensive studies since the beginning of the 21st century have
   provided vast amounts of knowledge about soil microbial diversity at
   local and global scales. However, microbial habitats have been poorly
   investigated at large scale. This study aims to characterize soil
   bacterial habitats across France for the first time by integrating the
   description of numerous environmental factors and human activities.
   Location We focus on the large spatial scale of mainland France using
   the largest spatially explicit soil sampling set available across France
   (2,173 soils, area = 5.5 x 10(5) km(2)).
   Major taxa studied Soil bacteria and archaea were studied by a high
   throughput sequencing approach targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S
   ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene directly amplified from soil DNA.
   Methods We applied decision tree learning and geostatistical approaches
   combining the abundant data on soil microbes and large-scale
   environmental description in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis
   of soil bacterial and archaeal communities.
   Results We identified a complex mosaic of 16 distinct terrestrial
   habitats, based on soil type and management (pH, C : N ratio, land use).
   As for plants and animals, each habitat hosted generalist and specialist
   taxa and a specific interaction network directly or indirectly impacted
   by human activities.
   Main conclusions In a context of global change, our results emphasize
   that the policies for biodiversity and habitat conservation should now
   integrate soil microorganisms conceptually and technically.},

Abstract = {Although sacred groves arc, important for conservation in India, The
   landscape that surrounds them has a vital influence on biodiversity
   within them. Research has focused on tree diversity inside these forest
   patches. In a coffee-growing region of the Western Ghats, however
   landscape outside sacred groves is also tree covered because Planters
   have retained native trees to provide shade for coffee plants. We
   examined the diversity of trees, birds, and macrofungi at 58 sites-10
   forest-reserve sites, 25 sacred groves, and 23 coffee plantations-in
   Kodagu district. We measured landscape composition and configuration
   around each site with a geographic information system. To identify
   factors associated with diversity we constructed multivariate models by
   using a decision-tree technique. The conventional measures of landscape
   such as patch size did not influence species richness. Distance of
   sacred groves front The forest reserve bad a weak influence. The
   measures of landscape structure (e.g., tree cover in the surroundings)
   and stand structure (e.g., variability in canopy height) contributed to
   The variation in species richness explained by multivariate models. We
   suggest that biodiversity present within sacred groves bets been
   influenced by native tree cover in the surrounding landscape. To
   conserve this biodiversity The integrity of the tree-covered landscape
   matrix will need to be conserved.},

Abstract = {In the light of unprecedented planetary changes in biodiversity,
   real-time and accurate ecosystem and biodiversity assessments are
   becoming increasingly essential for informing policy and sustainable
   development. Biodiversity monitoring is a challenge, especially for
   large areas such as entire continents. Nowadays, spaceborne and airborne
   sensors provide information that incorporate wavelengths that cannot be
   seen nor imagined with the human eye. This is also now accomplished at
   unprecedented spatial resolutions, defined by the pixel size of images,
   achieving less than a meter for some satellite images and just
   millimeters for airborne imagery. Thanks to different modeling
   techniques, it is now possible to study functional diversity changes
   over different spatial and temporal scales. At the heart of this
   unifying framework are the ``spectral species{''}-sets of pixels with a
   similar spectral signal-and their variability over space. The aim of
   this paper is to summarize the power of remote sensing for directly
   estimating plant species diversity, particularly focusing on the
   spectral species concept.},

Abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being applied to
   terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments, providing
   cost-efficient methods for surveying biodiversity. However, processing
   the avalanche of audio recordings remains challenging, and represents
   nowadays a major bottleneck that slows down its application in research
   and conservation. We present scikit-maad, an open-source Python package
   dedicated to the analysis of environmental audio recordings. This
   package was designed to (a) load and process digital audio, (b) segment
   and find regions of interest, (c) compute acoustic features and (d)
   estimate sound pressure levels. The package also provides field
   recordings and a comprehensive online documentation that includes
   practical examples with step-by-step instructions for beginners and
   advanced users. scikit-maad opens the possibility to efficiently scan
   large audio datasets and easily integrate additional machine learning
   Python packages into the analysis, allowing to measure acoustic
   properties and identify key patterns in all kinds of soundscapes. To
   support reproducible research, the package is released under the BSD
   open-source licence, which allows unrestricted redistribution for
   commercial and private use. This development will create synergies
   between the community of ecoacousticians, such as engineers, data
   scientists, ecologists, biologists and conservation practitioners, to
   explore and understand the processes underlying the acoustic diversity
   of ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Species diversity, and the various interactions that occur between
   species, supports ecosystems functioning and benefit human societies.
   Monitoring the response of species interactions to human alterations of
   the environment is thus crucial for preserving ecosystems. Ecological
   networks are now the standard method for representing and simultaneously
   analyzing all the interactions between species. However, deciphering
   such networks requires considerable time and resources to observe and
   sample the organisms, to identify them at the species level and to
   characterize their interactions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
   techniques, combined with network learning and modelling, can help
   alleviate these constraints. They are essential for observing cryptic
   interactions involving microbial species, as well as short-term
   interactions such as those between predator and prey. Here, we present
   three case studies, in which species associations or interactions have
   been revealed with NGS. We then review several currently available
   statistical and machine-learning approaches that could be used for
   reconstructing networks of direct interactions between species, based on
   the NGS co-occurrence data. Future developments of these methods may
   allow us to discover and monitor species interactions cost-effectively,
   under various environmental conditions and within a replicated
   experimental design framework.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {657-678},

Abstract = {Background and aim: Human society relies on four main livestock animals:
   sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle. All were domesticated at nearly the same
   time and place. But why only these few and not others? And why are
   livestock domestication rates not uniform across biogeographic realms?
   Perspective and dataset: I survey the global occurrence of large
   manunalian herbivore genera around 15,000 to 5000 years before present
   (BP), and compile a dataset characterizing their ecology, habitats, and
   dental traits.
   Methods of analysis: Predictive modelling of the probability of
   domestication using machine learning (decision trees and logistic
   regression). I extract patterns from the resulting models to highlight
   ecological differences between domesticated and non-domesticated genera.
   I analyse the estimated probabilities of domestication across
   biogeographic realms and in the context of local climatic conditions.
   Conclusions: The most suitable genera for domestication appear to be
   generalists adapted to persistence in marginal environments of low
   productivity, largely corresponding to cold, semi-arid climate zones.
   Although domestication rates varied across continents, potentially
   suitable candidate animals were rather unifonnly distributed across
   continents. I propose that the rates of domestication across
   biogeographic realms largely depend upon how much intersection between
   hot and cold semi-arid climatic zones was available on each continent.},

Title = {Hierarchical classification of pollinating flying insects under changing

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},

Volume = {70},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Automatic monitoring of flying insects enables quick and efficient
   observations and management of ecologically and economically important
   targets such as pollinators, disease vectors, and agricultural pests.
   Studies on this topic mainly cover the tasks of detection and
   identification or classification, the latter often guided by the flight
   sounds of insects. This paper uses domain knowledge and taxonomy
   information to classify bee and wasp species based on abiotic variables
   and wing-beat data that change depending on climatic-environmental
   conditions. We survey the state-of-the-art in hierarchical
   classification and evaluate the most popular local and global methods
   for this task on flight data from nine hymenopteran species. We
   collected the data in Brazilian fields employing an inexpensive optical
   sensor. Our results show that it is possible to hierarchically classify
   groups of specimens per species, species, and groups of species
   according to their wing-beat data at different temperature and relative
   humidity levels with at least 91\% accuracy. Besides benefiting research
   aimed at building insect classifiers adaptable to natural variations in
   the environment, this study is a vital step in a series of efforts to
   design non-invasive species monitoring techniques.},

Abstract = {Prelinguistic babbling is a critical phase in infant language
   development and is best understood in temperate songbirds where it
   occurs primarily in males at reproductive maturity and is modulated by
   sex steroids. Parrots of both sexes are icons of tropical vocal
   plasticity, but vocal babbling is unreported in this group and whether
   the endocrine system is involved is unknown. Here we show that vocal
   babbling is widespread in a wild parrot population in Venezuela, ensues
   in both sexes during the nestling stage, occurs amidst a captive
   audience of mixed-aged siblings, and is modulated by corticosteroids.
   Spectrographic analysis and machine learning found phoneme diversity and
   combinatorial capacity increased precipitously for the first week,
   thereafter, crystalizing into a smaller repertoire, consistent with the
   selective attrition model of language development.
   Corticosterone-treated nestlings differed from unmanipulated birds and
   sham controls in several acoustic properties and crystallized a larger
   repertoire post-treatment. Our findings indicate babbling occurs during
   an early life-history stage in which corticosteroids help catalyse the
   transition from a universal learning programme to one finely tuned for
   the prevailing ecological environment, a potentially convergent scenario
   in human prelinguistic development.},

Abstract = {A major objective of evolutionary biology is to understand the processes
   by which organisms have adapted to various environments, and to predict
   the response of organisms to new or future conditions. The availability
   of large genomic and environmental data sets provides an opportunity to
   address those questions, and the R package LEA has been introduced to
   facilitate population and ecological genomic analyses in this context.
   By using latent factor models, the program computes ancestry
   coefficients from population genetic data and performs
   genotype-environment association analyses with correction for unobserved
   confounding variables. In this study, we present new functionalities of
   LEA, which include imputation of missing genotypes, fast algorithms for
   latent factor mixed models using multivariate predictors for
   genotype-environment association studies, population differentiation
   tests for admixed or continuous populations, and estimation of genetic
   offset based on climate models. The new functionalities are implemented
   in version 3.1 and higher releases of the package. Using simulated and
   real data sets, our study provides evaluations and examples of
   applications, outlining important practical considerations when
   analysing ecological genomic data in R.},

Title = {A multicomponent approach to studying cultural propensities during
   foraging in the wild},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Determining the cultural propensities or cultural behaviours of a
   species during foraging entails an investigation of underlying drivers
   and motivations. In this article, we propose a multicomponent approach
   involving behaviour, ecology, and physiology to accelerate the study of
   cultural propensities in the wild. We propose as the first component the
   use of field experiments that simulate natural contexts, such as
   foraging behaviours and tool use opportunities, to explore social
   learning and cultural tendencies in a variety of species. To further
   accelerate this component, we discuss and advocate for the use of modern
   machine learning video analysis tools. In conjunction, we examine
   non-invasive methods to measure ecological influences on foraging such
   as phenology, fruit availability, dietary intake; and physiological
   influences such as stress, protein balance, energetics, and metabolism.
   We feature non-invasive urine sampling to investigate urea, creatinine,
   ketone bodies, the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), cortisol and
   connecting peptides of insulin. To conclude, we highlight the benefits
   of combining ecological and physiological conditions with behavioural
   field experiments. This can be done across wild species, and provides
   the framework needed to test ecological hypotheses related to cultural
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {Species distribution modeling, which allows users to predict the spatial
   distribution of species with the use of environmental covariates, has
   become increasingly popular, with many software platforms providing
   tools to fit such models. However, the species observations used can
   have varying levels of quality and can have incomplete information, such
   as uncertain or unknown species identity.
   In this paper, we develop two algorithms to classify observations with
   unknown species identities which simultaneously predict several species
   distributions using spatial point processes. Through simulations, we
   compare the performance of these algorithms using 7 different
   initializations to the performance of models fitted using only the
   observations with known species identity.
   We show that performance varies with differences in correlation among
   species distributions, species abundance, and the proportion of
   observations with unknown species identities. Additionally, some of the
   methods developed here outperformed the models that did not use the
   misspecified data. We applied the best-performing methods to a dataset
   of three frog species (Mixophyes).
   These models represent a helpful and promising tool for opportunistic
   surveys where misidentification is possible or for the distribution of
   species newly separated in their taxonomy.},

Title = {From theoretical to actual ecosystem services: mapping beneficiaries and
   spatial flows in ecosystem service assessments},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services mapping and modeling has focused more on supply than
   demand, until recently. Whereas the potential provision of economic
   benefits from ecosystems to people is often quantified through
   ecological production functions, the use of and demand for ecosystem
   services has received less attention, as have the spatial flows of
   services from ecosystems to people. However, new modeling approaches
   that map and quantify service-specific sources (ecosystem capacity to
   provide a service), sinks (biophysical or anthropogenic features that
   deplete or alter service flows), users (user locations and level of
   demand), and spatial flows can provide a more complete understanding of
   ecosystem services. Through a case study in Puget Sound, Washington
   State, USA, we quantify and differentiate between the theoretical or in
   situ provision of services, i.e., ecosystems' capacity to supply
   services, and their actual provision when accounting for the location of
   beneficiaries and the spatial connections that mediate service flows
   between people and ecosystems. Our analysis includes five ecosystem
   services: carbon sequestration and storage, riverine flood regulation,
   sediment regulation for reservoirs, open space proximity, and scenic
   viewsheds. Each ecosystem service is characterized by different
   beneficiary groups and means of service flow. Using the ARtificial
   Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) methodology we map service
   supply, demand, and flow, extending on simpler approaches used by past
   studies to map service provision and use. With the exception of the
   carbon sequestration service, regions that actually provided services to
   people, i.e., connected to beneficiaries via flow paths, amounted to
   16-66\% of those theoretically capable of supplying services, i.e., all
   ecosystems across the landscape. These results offer a more complete
   understanding of the spatial dynamics of ecosystem services and their
   effects, and may provide a sounder basis for economic valuation and
   policy applications than studies that consider only theoretical service
   provision and/or use.},

Title = {Use of object detection in camera trap image identification: Assessing a
   method to rapidly and accurately classify human and animal detections
   for research and application in recreation ecology},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Camera traps are increasingly used to answer complex ecological
   questions. However, the rapidly growing number of images collected
   presents technical challenges. Each image must be classified to extract
   data, requiring significant labor, and potentially creating an
   information bottleneck. We applied an object detection model
   (MegaDetector) to camera trap data from a study of recreation ecology in
   British Columbia, Canada. We tested its performance in detecting humans
   and animals relative to manual image classifications, and assessed
   efficiency by comparing the time required for manual classification
   versus a modified workflow integrating object detection with manual
   classification. We also evaluated the reliability of using MegaDetector
   to create an index of human activity for application to the study of
   recreation impacts to wildlife. In our application, Mega Detector
   detected human and animal images with 99\% and 82\% precision, and 95\%
   and 92\% recall respectively, at a confidence threshold of 90\%.
   Processing speed was increased by over 500\%, and the time required for
   the manual processing component was reduced by 8.4 x. The index of human
   detection events from MegaDetector matched the output from manual
   classification, with a mean 0.45\% difference in estimated human
   detections across site-weeks. Our test of an open-source object
   detection model showed it performed well in partially classifying a
   camera trap dataset, significantly increasing processing efficiency. We
   suggest that this tool could be integrated into existing camera trap
   workflows to accelerate research and application by alleviating data
   bottlenecks, particularly for surveys processing large volumes of human
   images. We also show how the model and workflow can be used to anonymize
   human images prior to classification, protecting individual privacy.},

Title = {Connectivity metrics for conservation planning and monitoring},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {255},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Conservation plans increasingly include goals to maintain a connected
   network. For example, planners might design a linkage between two
   conserved areas, or the parties to the Convention on Biological
   Diversity might set targets for a well-connected system of protected
   areas for each nation. Here we describe 35 metrics that can quantify
   connectivity of focal patches or of networks and monitor changes over
   time in an ecoscape (landscape or seascape). The connectivity metrics
   fall into four categories: (1) structural connectivity metrics derived
   from binary maps and species-nonspecific spatial functions, (2)
   connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-specific
   population sizes and dispersal functions (3) metrics derived from
   multi-state maps and species responses to those states, and (4) metrics
   of functional connectivity reflecting observed flow of organisms or
   genes. We provide a decision tree to select which of these metrics are
   most appropriate for a given conservation goal and broad ecoscape
   context. Functional connectivity metrics may be preferred if
   conservation is focused on particular species or if data are available
   to parameterize models for a suite of species that represent needs of
   the focal biota. However, with climate change, ecoscapes need to
   facilitate movements of all species that need to adapt by shifting their
   ranges. Because an intact network of relatively natural areas may
   support movement for many species, structural metrics that consider the
   human footprint should be used in all coarse filter approximations of
   functional connectivity in shared ecoscapes.},

Abstract = {The species composition of a community is a subset of the regional
   species pool, and predicting the species composition of a community from
   ecological traits of organisms is an important objective in ecology. If
   such a prediction can be made feasible, we could assess the risk of
   invasion of locally new species (alien species and genetically modified
   species) into natural communities. We developed and tested statistical
   models to predict a community's species composition from ecological
   traits of the species pool. Various types of communities (forest,
   meadow, and weed communities) exist in a small area of traditional rural
   landscape in Japan, and have been maintained by human activities. These
   communities and the tracheophytes species pool in the 1-km(2) research
   area were considered. We used logistic regression and decision-tree
   analysis to construct predictive models of community species composition
   based on plant traits, using the presence or absence of species in a
   community as the dependent variable and ecological traits as independent
   variables. Plant traits were grouped by cluster analysis, and the
   average in each trait group was used for model building to avoid
   multiple collinearity. Statistical prediction models were significant in
   all communities. About 60-75\% of species composition could be predicted
   from the measured plant traits in forest communities, but 33-56\% in the
   meadow and weed communities. Our results showed the possibility of
   predicting the species composition of plant communities from the
   ecological traits of the plant species together with the information on
   local species pool.},

Title = {Mapping vegetation in an arid, mountainous region of Western Australia},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-200},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {. Predictive mapping of vegetation using models linking vegetation units
   to mapped environmental variables has been advocated for remote areas.
   In this study, three different types of model were employed (within a
   GIS) to produce vegetation maps of the Hamersley Ranges region of
   Western Australia. The models were: (1) decision trees; (2) statistical
   models; and (3) heuristic/conceptual models. Maps were produced for
   three different levels of a floristic classification, i.e. 16
   communities in two community groups with eight subgroups. All models
   satisfactorily established relationships between the vegetation units
   and available predictor variables, except where the number of sites of a
   particular unit was small. The different models often made similar
   predictions, especially for more widespread vegetation units. Map
   accuracy (as determined by field testing of maps) improved with
   increasing level of abstraction, with plant community maps ca. 50 \%
   correct, subgroup maps ca. 60 \% correct and group maps 90 \% correct.
   Map inaccuracies were due to several factors, including low sample
   numbers producing unrepresentative models, poor resolution of and errors
   in available maps of predictor variables, and available predictor
   variables not being able to differentiate between certain vegetation
   units, particularly at the plant community level. Of these factors, poor
   resolution of maps was seen as the most critical. One type of model
   could not be recommended over another; however the choice of model will

Title = {Operationalizing a land systems classification for Laos},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {229-240},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Land cover data is widely used for the design and monitoring of land use
   policies despite the incapability of this type of data to represent
   multiple land uses and land management activities within the same
   landscape. In this study, we operationalized the concept of land systems
   for the case of the Lao PDR (Laos). Distinct land systems like shifting
   cultivation and plantations (land concessions) cannot be fully captured
   by land cover inventories alone, in spite of their relevance for land
   use policies. Using a decision tree and a matrix approach, we integrated
   several datasets for the period 2010/11, including land cover, an
   agricultural census and a land concession inventory. We selected
   thresholds for distinguishing land systems based on an expert survey.
   The resulting 17 land systems cover the whole territory of Laos and
   represent landscapes of 2 x 2 km pixel size. The largest area is
   occupied by smallholder agriculture land systems intertwined with
   forests. Only 27\% of the territory are agriculturally undisturbed,
   dense forest systems. The assessment can serve as a basis to identify
   areas that could change shortly and locates the full range of land
   systems, from land concessions to smallholder systems, in one,
   integrated spatial assessment. The land system representation can help
   policy makers to link land systems to the diversity of different
   stakeholders and their backgrounds and support discussions about
   ecologic and socioeconomic consequences of different land uses within a
   landscape.},

Title = {Do 120,000 years of plant-pollinator interactions predict floral

Abstract = {Quaternary climatic changes impacted species' demography and
   distribution worldwide. Although response to climate change could have
   been modulated by mutualistic interactions with other species, studies
   exploring the dynamics of these interactions and their role facilitating
   species persistence during past climatic variations are scarce. In this
   work, we attempt to explore the spatial dynamic of Calceolaria polyrhiza
   and its oil-collecting bee pollinators during the last 120,000 years,
   identifying stable areas of persistence and statistically determining
   whether the distribution of pollinator-related floral ecotypes is
   associated with these shared areas of persistence. To do this, we used
   395 presence records of the interacting species and constructed species
   palaeodistribution models. Additionally, we gathered phenotypic measures
   of the plant and used decision tree and multiple regression analyses to
   link the plant phenotypic divergence with the distribution of stable
   areas. Our species distribution models suggest that past climatic
   changes affected the interaction between C. polyrhiza and both bee
   species in time and space. While the interaction between the plant and
   C. caeruleus predominated in the Andean-Patagonian forest and was
   relatively stable in space and time, that was not the case for the
   pollinator C. cineraria in the Patagonian steppe. This, along with our
   analyses of spatial phenotypic divergence, indicates that current floral
   phenotypes are the result of two historical different pollination
   regimes.},

Title = {Applying ecological principles to maximize resistance to invasion in
   restored plant communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {190},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Considerable resources are spent worldwide to manage invasive plant
   species and preserve the integrity and diversity of native or restored
   habitats and communities. Here, we review empirical evidence to identify
   relevant ecological principles and practices that could guide plant
   community restoration when the goal is to prevent re -invasion after
   management of an invasive species. Our focus is on the restoration of
   North American freshwater or tidal wetland communities after invasion by
   Phragmites australis, but our findings could apply to the design and
   restoration of invasion-resistant communities for any plant invader. The
   ecological principles that emerge from this review are (1) seedling
   establishment of P. australis provides a critical window for limiting
   invasion through ecological resistance; (2) abiotic conditions modulate
   ecological resistance; (3) resident species do best when they have a
   head start on the invader; (4) competition through limiting similarity
   can help strengthen ecological resistance; (5) species and functional
   diversity enhance invasion resistance through complementarity effects;
   and (6) propagule pressure of the invader and seeding density of the
   resident species interact to determine invasion success. We propose a
   conceptual model that synthesizes these ecological principles as well as
   a decision tree in support of field applications. Finally, we conclude
   by encouraging experiments that encompass the temporal and spatial
   variability of restored ecosystems to test the limits of these
   principles and better support the applications of, and generalization
   about, ecological resistance.},

Title = {An introduction to event history analyses for ecologists},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Efforts to understand the emergence of an event require our ability to
   measure and understand the dynamics between time in a state (e.g., being
   alive or a behavior) and the outcome of the state. Studying the main
   drivers that affect changes in state over time allows researchers to
   better understand population dynamics and evolutionary processes. Event
   history analyses provide a range of theoretical and empirical tools to
   explore the emergence of an event. Their use is still restricted in
   ecology; however, they are commonly used in human demography. Event
   history analysis is a powerful tool for measuring the probability that
   an event occurs at time t. Here, we provide an introductory guide for
   ecologists who are interested in exploring event history analyses in
   their research. In the first part of this article, we outline key
   concepts in event history analyses and present a decision tree,
   statistical techniques, and their applications to ecological questions.
   To introduce practical applications of event history analyses, we
   provide four detailed tutorials, stemming from observational and
   longitudinal records of events in mammalian and avian species, along
   with relevant R scripts. We then explain how to interpret and present
   results of such analyses. Our results show that event history analyses
   are useful to quantify the effect of factors on the emergence of events.
   We conclude by highlighting additional strengths, pitfalls, and
   limitations researchers should be aware of when using such methods. We
   foresee the use of event history analyses for ecological studies.},

Abstract = {In spite of considerable progress made in the prevention and control of
   schistosomiasis and other snail-borne diseases, transmission has
   intensified in some endemic areas as a result of land-use and climate
   changes. We used decision tree models and multivariate analysis to
   identify factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of medically
   important freshwater snail intermediate hosts in the Omo-Gibe river
   basin, Ethiopia. The models were based on a dataset of 140 samples
   collected from lakes, wetlands, rivers, dam reservoir shores and
   irrigation canals. A total of 1866 freshwater snails belonging to four
   genera and seven species were collected. Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Lymnaea
   natalensis and Bulinus globosus had fair to moderate predictive
   performance based on Kappa statistics (K > 0.2), indicating that these
   species have clear environmental requirements within the habitat
   gradient studied. The most important variables influencing the abundance
   and occurrence of snail species were the presence of predator and
   competitor, canopy cover, type of water body, waste dumping and water
   pH. In conclusion, snail species occurred less frequently and in smaller
   numbers in water bodies with minimal human disturbances. Therefore,
   preventing human disturbance in water bodies may enhance aquatic
   biodiversity, thereby increasing the abundance of snail predators and
   competitors. Preventing the pollution of these ecosystems is essential
   to maintain their ecological integrity and sustain the ecosystem
   services they provide to local communities.},

Title = {Assessing the accuracy of free automated plant identification
   applications},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Abstract = {Widely available and inexpensive mobile phone applications offer users,
   whether professional ecologists or interested amateurs, the potential
   for simple and rapid automated identification of species, without the
   need to use field guides and identification keys. The increasing
   accuracy of machine learning is well established, but it is currently
   unclear if, and under what circumstances, free-to-use mobile phone
   applications are accurate for identifying plants to species level in
   real-world field conditions. We test five popular and free
   identification applications for plants using 857 professionally
   identified images of 277 species from 204 genera. Across all
   applications, 85\% of images were identified correctly in the top five
   suggestions, and 69\% were correct with the first suggestion. Plant type
   (woody, forbs, grasses, rushes/sedges, ferns/horsetails) was a
   significant determinant of identification performance for each
   application. For some applications, image saliency was also important;
   exposure and focus were not significant. Applications performed well,
   with at least one of the three best-performing applications identifying
   96\% of images correctly as their first suggestion. We conclude that,
   subject to some caveats, free phone-based plant identification
   applications are valid and useful tools for those wanting rapid
   identification and for anyone wanting to engage with the natural world.

Title = {Recommender systems for fossil community distribution modelling},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1690-1706},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We propose to leverage recommender systems from machine learning to
   build large-scale community distribution models for the mammalian fossil
   record. Recommender systems are behind most online life today, from
   shopping to news personalisation, online dating, or the selection of
   study programmes or fastest routes. Many recommender systems work by
   predicting user preferences from items that occur together in user
   profiles. Technically, this setting closely resembles co-occurrence of
   species in natural environments. Here we frame community distribution
   modelling as a recommender systems task, tailor existing recommender
   techniques for this purpose and propose optimisation criteria for
   fitting the models in the ecological context. The predictive power comes
   from species co-occurrences. We demonstrate the potential of this
   approach for analysing past ecosystems on a case study of Miocene fossil
   sites in Europe, where we use the proposed community distribution
   modelling for reconstructing companionships and relative abundances of
   large mammals. The proposed approach to community distribution
   modelling, although not climatically explicit, can help to reconstruct
   past ecosystems and analyse their structure and dynamics over time and
   space. It also allows, even coarsely, to predict relative abundances of
   fossil species from presence-absence data. More generally, the proposed
   perspective is a means for analysis of fossil communities and the
   relationships between their ecological contexts.},

Series = {Advances in Ecological Research},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {1+},
Abstract = {Ecological network analysis (ENA) provides a mechanistic framework for
   describing complex species interactions, quantifying ecosystem services,
   and examining the impacts of environmental change on ecosystems. In this
   chapter, we highlight the importance and potential of ENA in future
   biomonitoring programs, as current biomonitoring indicators (e.g.
   species richness, population abundances of targeted species) are mostly
   descriptive and unable to characterize the mechanisms that underpin
   ecosystem functioning. Measuring the robustness of multilayer networks
   in the long term is one way of integrating ecological metrics more
   generally into biomonitoring schemes to better measure biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks are nevertheless difficult
   and labour-intensive to construct using conventional approaches,
   especially when building multilayer networks in poorly studied
   ecosystems (i.e. many tropical regions). Next-generation sequencing
   (NGS) provides unprecedented opportunities to rapidly build highly
   resolved species interaction networks across multiple trophic levels,
   but are yet to be fully exploited. We highlight the impediments to
   ecologists wishing to build DNA-based ecological networks and discuss
   some possible solutions. Machine learning and better data sharing
   between ecologists represent very important areas for advances in
   NGS-based networks. The future of network ecology is very exciting as
   all the tools necessary to build highly resolved multilayer networks are
   now within ecologists reach.},

Title = {Categorization of green and grey infrastructure complexity in the
   rural-urban interface of Bengaluru, India: an unsupervised volumetric
   approach with relevance for urban quality},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Abstract = {Trees are key elements of urban green infrastructure and provide
   multiple ecosystem services that are essential for the quality of life
   of people in urban environments. Grey infrastructure is made up of
   buildings or built-up area, generally characterized by imperviousness of
   the surface. The complexity of urban green and grey infrastructure and
   their interactions co-define the quality of urban life and the
   ecological value of urban areas. Using conventional dichotomies by
   separation into ``urban{''} and ``rural{''} contexts does hardly allow
   to comprehensively assess the situation in rapidly urbanizing
   environments of the Global South. We present an unsupervised remote
   sensing-based approach that integrates 3D information to objectively
   categorize the complexity of green and grey infrastructure. Using the
   rural-urban interface of Bengaluru, India, as a case example, we
   distinguished five categories that describe the composition and
   configuration of green and grey infrastructure, where three variables
   served as indicators for categorization into five clusters. We argue
   that such integrated 3D assessment of green and grey infrastructure is
   particularly useful for understanding and classifying ``rurban{''}
   environments, where a distinction between urban and rural is often no
   longer possible. Our final map allows to quantitatively characterize
   such rurban configurations.},

Title = {Simulations of human migration into North America are more sensitive to
   demography than choice of palaeoclimate model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Reconstructions of the spatiotemporal dynamics of human dispersal away
   from evolutionary origins in Africa are important for determining the
   ecological consequences of the arrival of anatomically modern humans in
   naive landscapes and interpreting inferences from ancient genomes on
   indigenous population history. While efforts have been made to
   independently validate these projections against the archaeological
   record and contemporary measures of genetic diversity, there has been no
   comprehensive assessment of how parameter values and choice of
   palaeoclimate model affect projections of early human migration. We
   simulated human migration into North America with a process-explicit
   migration model using simulated palaeoclimate data from two different
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and did a sensitivity
   analysis on the outputs using a machine learning algorithm. We found
   that simulated human migration into North America was more sensitive to
   un-certainty in demographic parameters than choice of atmosphere-ocean
   general circulation model used for simulating climate-human
   interactions. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of
   process-explicit human migration models will be improved with further
   research on the population dynamics of ancient humans, and that
   uncertainties in model parameters must be considered in estimates of the
   timing and rate of human colo-nisation and their consequence on
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The complex transmission ecologies of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases
   pose challenges to their control, especially in changing landscapes.
   Human incidence of zoonotic malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi) is associated
   with deforestation although mechanisms are unknown. Here, a novel
   application of a method for predicting disease occurrence that combines
   machine learning and statistics is used to identify the key spatial
   scales that define the relationship between zoonotic malaria cases and
   environmental change. Using data from satellite imagery, a case-control
   study, and a cross-sectional survey, predictive models of
   household-level occurrence of P. knowlesi were fitted with 16 variables
   summarized at 11 spatial scales simultaneously. The method identified a
   strong and well-defined peak of predictive influence of the proportion
   of cleared land within 1 km of households on P. knowlesi occurrence.
   Aspect (1 and 2 km), slope (0.5 km) and canopy regrowth (0.5 km) were
   important at small scales. By contrast, fragmentation of deforested
   areas influenced P. knowlesi occurrence probability most strongly at
   large scales (4 and 5 km). The identification of these spatial scales
   narrows the field of plausible mechanisms that connect land use change
   and P. knowlesi, allowing for the refinement of disease occurrence
   predictions and the design of spatially-targeted interventions.},

Abstract = {Capitellid polychaetes are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and
   are often encountered in high abundance. We used an extensive dataset of
   species abundance and distribution records of the Capitella capitata
   complex, C. aciculata, C. jonesi, Heteromastus filiformis, Mediomastus
   ambiseta, and M. californiensis from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, as a model
   system of closely related species filling a similar ecological niche. We
   sought to (1) characterize the spatial distribution of each species, (2)
   determine if a single species abundance modeling strategy could be
   applied to them all, and (3) assess environmental drivers of species
   distribution and abundance. We found that all species had a
   zero-inflated abundance distribution and there was spatial
   autocorrelation by bay regions. Lorenz curves were an effective tool to
   assess spatial patterns of species abundance across large areas. Bay
   segment, depth, and dissolved oxygen were the most important
   environmental drivers. Modeling was accomplished by comparing 6
   different approaches: 4 generalized additive models (GAMs: Poisson,
   negative binomial, Tweedie, and zero-inflated Poisson distributions),
   hurdle models, and boosted regression trees. There was no single model
   with top performance for every species. However, GAM-Tweedie and hurdle
   models performed well overall and may be useful for studies of other
   benthic marine invertebrates.},

Abstract = {Studying the macroevolution of the songs of Passeriformes (perching
   birds) has proved challenging. The complexity of the task stems not just
   from the macroevolutionary and macroecological challenge of modeling so
   many species, but also from the difficulty in collecting and quantifying
   birdsong itself. Using machine learning techniques, we extracted songs
   from a large citizen science dataset, and then analyzed the evolution,
   and biotic and abiotic predictors of variation in birdsong across 578
   passerine species. Contrary to expectations, we found few links between
   life-history traits (monogamy and sexual dimorphism) and the evolution
   of song pitch (peak frequency) or song complexity (standard deviation of
   frequency). However, we found significant support for morphological
   constraints on birdsong, as reflected in a negative correlation between
   bird size and song pitch. We also found that broad-scale biogeographical
   and climate factors such as net primary productivity, temperature, and
   regional species richness were significantly associated with both the
   evolution and present-day distribution of bird song features. Our
   analysis integrates comparative and spatial modeling with newly
   developed data cleaning and curation tools, and suggests that
   evolutionary history, morphology, and present-day ecological processes
   shape the distribution of song diversity in these charismatic and
   important birds.},

Title = {Relative importance of environmental, geographic, and spatial variables
   on zooplankton metacommunities},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding the factors responsible for structuring ecological
   communities is a central goal in community ecology. Previous work has
   focused on determining the relative roles of two classes of variables
   (e.g., spatial and environmental) on community composition. However,
   this approach may ignore the disproportionate impact of variables within
   classes, and is often confounded by spatial autocorrelation leading to
   collinearity among variables of different classes. Here, we combine
   pattern-based metacommunity and machine learning analyses to
   characterize metacommunity structure of zooplankton from lakes in the
   northeast United States and to identify environmental, spatial, and
   geographic covariates associated with metacommunity structure. Analyses
   were performed for the entire metacommunity and for three zooplankton
   subsets (cladocerans, copepods, and rotifers), as the variables
   associated with community structure in these groups were hypothesized to
   differ. Species distributions of all subsets adhered to an
   environmental, spatial, and/or geographic gradient, but differed in
   metacommunity pattern, as copepod species distributions responded
   independently of one another, while the entire zooplankton
   metacommunity, cladocerans, and rotifers replaced one another in
   discrete groups. While environmental variables were nearly always the
   most important to metacommunity structure, the relative importance of
   variables differed among zooplankton subsets, suggesting that
   zooplankton subsets differ in their environmental tolerances and
   dispersal-limitation.},

Title = {Diversity, structure, and application of self organizing map on plant
   species in homegardens},
Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {The high diversity of plant species in homegardens contributes to the
   provision of a range of goods and services, as well as considerably
   benefiting the environment and boosting ecological sustainability.
   Despite their importance, homegardens in Malaysia have not been
   systematically studied. This paper explores the diversity of useful
   plant species in Malaysian homegardens, as well as their vertical
   structure. The effect of the size of homegardens and socio-economic
   variables on the diversity of plants species were also investigated by
   using Self Organizing Map, a type of machine learning method. In total,
   207 species of useful plants distributed among 169 genera and 78
   families were recorded. At the species level, Musa paradisiaca L. had
   the highest frequency, while Euphorbiaceae had the highest at the family
   level. The vertical structure of homegardens was divided into five
   distinct layers: herbaceous layer, shrub layer, understory layer, canopy
   layer and emergent layer. Plant diversity is influenced by the size of
   homegardens and socioeconomic variables. As the size of the homegardens
   increased, as such increased the diversity of plant species.
   Lower-income households and worked in agriculture sectors that rely on
   homegrown food and medicinal plants are increasing the diversity of
   plant species in homegardens, highlighting the importance of these
   agroecosystems as a food security approach.},

Abstract = {Prediction of species' distributions is central to diverse applications
   in ecology, evolution and conservation science. There is increasing
   electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and
   herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this
   information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling
   distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over
   226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive
   set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit
   models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the
   predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as
   generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods
   that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to
   modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods
   and community models, both of which have features that may make them
   particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical
   of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for
   modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel
   methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results
   of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and
   herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such
   data improve.},

Title = {VALUATION OF WETLAND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN RAPIDLY URBANIZING REGION: A
   CASE STUDY OF THE NANJING JIANGBEI NEW AREA, CHINA},

Abstract = {Wetlands are considered as one of the most important ecosystems on the
   Earth. Rapidly urbanizing, being an intense way of human activities, has
   brought significant impact on the ecological functions of urban
   wetlands. This study focused on the urban wetland ecosystem in the
   Nanjing Jiangbei New Area, China, and presented a dynamic integrated
   approach to assess the monetized value of its services. A classification
   decision tree model was adopted to interpret the Landsat TM/ETM/OLI
   images to obtain the LUCC data of urban wetlands in different years.
   Then an integrated approach was employed to correct the equivalent
   values and their prices of various ecosystem services, dynamically
   evaluating the value of wetland ecosystem services. The results showed
   that the overall value of the wetland ecosystem services of the Jiangbei
   New Area was 893.99 million USD, 1365.63 million USD and 1016.46 million
   USD in 2002, 2009 and 2015, respectively. Among the service categories,
   the regulating service reaches the most and the provisioning service
   contributes the least to the total value. According to the analysis of
   annual valuation results, it was inevitable that the ecological
   conditions of wetlands in the rapidly urbanizing area would deteriorate
   and the capability to provide ecosystem services would degenerate. This
   research suggests that rapid urban development should adopt an ecosystem
   service oriented strategy to align sustainable utilization with
   conservation and to recognize the interaction between the wetland
   ecosystem services and the forces of urbanization.},

Title = {Predicting the distribution and abundance of invasive plant species in a
   sub-tropical woodland-grassland ecosystem in northeastern India},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {220},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Invasive plant species have become increasingly problematic in tropical
   and sub-tropical ecosystems, with the potential to decrease native plant
   diversity, increase fire occurrence, and cause ecosystem degradation.
   Numerous factors including disturbance due to fire, grazing, roads,
   human activities, reduction of native diversity, and soil fertility are
   known to influence invasibility of a habitat and/or promote the spread
   of invasive species. We studied invasive species distribution and
   abundance in a 519 km(2) wildlife reserve that has sub-tropical woodland
   and grasslands. We sampled 134 plots of size 30 x 30 m(2) and found that
   Mikania micrantha (a climber) and Chromolaena odorata (a shrub) were the
   most prominent invasive plants. We then tested the influence of eleven
   environmental variables that are either direct measures or proxies of
   resource availability, vegetation density, disturbance, and moisture
   stress. Using these predictors, we performed a decision-tree-based
   regression and prediction to test the influence of these variables on
   invasive species abundance and to generate distribution maps. The model
   had significant predictive power in the case of Mikania (R-2 = 0.469)
   but was poor for Chromolaena (R-2 = 0.056). Annual precipitation, soil
   phosphorus, and vegetation attributes had a significant influence in
   Mikania, and fire frequency had the strongest influence on Chromolaena.
   We could not quantify direct disturbance such as cattle grazing and
   resource extraction, which could add to the predictive power for these
   species. Given that invasive species continue to expand in range and
   abundance, more directed ecological monitoring and analyses are needed
   to manage ecosystems under the threat of invasions.},

Abstract = {Incorporating ecological information into image-based vegetation mapping
   remains a challenge. Much attention has been placed on the use of
   ancillary information layers in image classification (e.g. slope,
   aspect, elevation) in that they provide indirect links to information
   that is ecologically relevant to species distributions. The objective of
   this study was to assess the utility of incorporating regression-based
   distribution model surfaces with image classification results using a
   consensus theoretic approach. We used spatially explicit non-parametric
   regression modeling in order to incorporate ancillary information in the
   production of an existing vegetation map for the Lake Tahoe basin.
   Probability surfaces for 19 prevalent species or genera were produced
   using generalized additive modeling (GAM). Models were fit to plot data
   obtained from multiple resource agencies using land-form based
   explanatory variables derived from a digital elevation model. Model
   evaluation was assessed by examining species response curves and through
   cross-validation, resulting in a range of accuracies for individual
   species (ROC values from 0.58 to 0.85). Probability surfaces for the
   study area were subsequently generated within a GIS. These surfaces were
   spatially re-sampled and used in conjunction with IKONOS imagery for use
   in vegetation mapping. The GAM surfaces were combined with maximum
   likelihood image classification results using consensus theory and a
   simple iterative weighting scheme. Results from the analysis demonstrate
   that the inclusion of the GAM surfaces improved individual class
   accuracies and suggests the need for implementing standardized and
   objective species modeling techniques for improving vegetation maps. (c)

Abstract = {Managing the nonlethal effects of disturbance on wildlife populations
   has been a long-term goal for decision makers, managers, and ecologists,
   and assessment of these effects is currently required by European Union
   and United States legislation. However, robust assessment of these
   effects is challenging. The management of human activities that have
   nonlethal effects on wildlife is a specific example of a fundamental
   ecological problem: how to understand the population-level consequences
   of changes in the behavior or physiology of individual animals that are
   caused by external stressors. In this study, we review recent
   applications of a conceptual framework for assessing and predicting
   these consequences for marine mammal populations. We explore the range
   of models that can be used to formalize the approach and we identify
   critical research gaps. We also provide a decision tree that can be used
   to select the most appropriate model structure given the available data.
   Synthesis and applications: The implementation of this framework has
   moved the focus of discussion of the management of nonlethal
   disturbances on marine mammal populations away from a rhetorical debate
   about defining negligible impact and toward a quantitative understanding
   of long-term population-level effects. Here we demonstrate the
   framework's general applicability to other marine and terrestrial
   systems and show how it can support integrated modeling of the proximate
   and ultimate mechanisms that regulate trait-mediated, indirect
   interactions in ecological communities, that is, the nonconsumptive
   effects of a predator or stressor on a species' behavior, physiology, or
   life history.},

Title = {Operationalising the concept of ecosystem collapse for conservation
   practice},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {264},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Concern is growing about ecosystem collapse, namely the abrupt decline
   or loss of an ecosystem resulting from human activities. While efforts
   to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse have developed at large spatial
   scales, less attention has been given to the local scales at which
   conservation management decisions are typically made. Development of
   appropriate management responses to ecosystem collapse has been limited
   by uncertainty regarding how collapse may best be identified, together
   with its underlying causes. Here we operationalise ecosystem collapse
   for conservation practice by providing a robust definition of collapse,
   in a form that is relevant to the scale of conservation decision-making.
   We provide an overview of different causes of collapse, and then explore
   the implications of this understanding for conservation practice, by
   examining potential management responses. This is achieved through
   development of a decision tree, which we illustrate through a series of
   case studies. We also explore the role of indicators for the early
   detection of collapse and for monitoring the effectiveness of management
   responses. Ecosystem collapse represents a significant challenge to
   conservation practice, as abrupt changes in ecosystem structure,
   function and composition can occur with little warning, leading to
   profound impacts on both biodiversity and human society. The risks of
   ecosystem collapse are likely to increase in future, as multiple forms
   of environmental change continue to intensify. We suggest that selection
   of management responses should be based on an understanding of the
   causal mechanisms responsible for collapse, which can be identified
   through appropriate monitoring and research activities.},

Title = {Simulations of spatial patterns and species distributions in sandy land
   using unmanned aerial vehicle images},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {186},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The spatial distribution of vegetation in sandy lands is closely related
   to micro-topography. Point pattern analysis of vegetation distribution
   from ground surveys and satellite images is a commonly used method but
   does not capture the influence of spatial heterogeneity at small scales.
   This study examined long-term ecological observation sites of elm (Ulmus
   pumila) sparse forest in the Otindag Sandy Land, China. Elevation models
   from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground survey data on
   vegetation structure from 3768 elms were used to classify the terrain of
   sampled sites using a decision tree classification. It combined terrain
   factors, including slope, aspect, and small-scale altitude differences.
   Plots were divided into five topographic types: sand flat (53\%), sand
   lowland (17\%), sunny slope (13\%), shady slope (10\%), and sandy ridges
   (7\%). Elm densities varied from 141.7 trees hm(-2) on shady slopes to
   17.0 trees hm(-2) on sand lowland. A 2D Poisson fitting method was
   applied to the diameter at breast height, crown width, and other
   vegetation growth characteristics to simulate and verify the
   distribution of elms in the plots. Multivariate analysis was undertaken
   to confirm the effect of topographic factors on variation of tree
   characteristics. The integrated terrain approach could better
   characterize the spatial distribution of sparse forests. This research
   demonstrated that UAVs were a useful tool to measure spatial
   heterogeneity of sand micro-topography. Simulations of the distribution
   of plant characteristics indicated that the terrain classification
   matched the spatial pattern analysis of elms in semi-arid regions.
   Simulation of vegetation distribution is a useful technique for

Abstract = {Understanding how the ecological niches of species are formulated across
   space is critical for modeling the current and predicting future
   distributions under climate change. Here, we examine how stable are the
   realized niches of distinct populations of the endangered green sea
   turtle (Chelonia mydas) which are defined on the basis of genetic and
   demographic data and are distributed around the globe. We used 906
   georeferenced records of green turtle nesting sites that are embedded
   within eight Regional Management Units to compare climatic niche for
   each one of the distinct units. We used an asymmetric overall index and
   a decision-tree model to assess niche conservatism through a comparison
   of temperature- and precipitation-based bioclimatic variables that
   characterize the climatic niche breadth of the spatially distinct
   population segments. We found a high degree of variance in climatic
   space, which also lacks any latitudinal pattern. Environmental
   determinants vary significantly across the studied population units:
   variables that have been long-recognized as critical for nesting (e.g.,
   maximum temperature of the warmest month) showed only low overlap
   between some of different regional entities. Our results contribute
   substantially to the current debate on the predictive power of species
   distribution models that use only climate variables as predictors when
   aggregating data from various populations. We argue that studies on
   climatic-niche evolution and divergent ecological selection mechanisms
   are required before attempting to identify suitable habitats for a
   species, describe climatic widths and search for plausible expansions of
   geographical shifts attributed to climate change.},

Abstract = {Aim Lepidium latifolium (Brassicaceae; perennial pepperweed) is a
   noxious Eurasian weed invading riparian and wetland areas of the western
   USA. Understanding which sites are most susceptible to invasion by L.
   latifolium will allow more efficient management of this weed. We
   assessed the ability of advanced remote sensing techniques to develop
   habitat suitability models for L. latifolium.
   Location San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta,
   California, USA.
   Methods Lepidium latifolium distribution was mapped with hyperspectral
   image data of Rush Ranch Open Space Preserve, providing presence/absence
   data to train and validate habitat models. A high-resolution light
   detection and ranging digital elevation model was used to derive
   predictor environmental variables (distance to channel, distance to
   upland, elevation, slope, aspect and convexity). Aggregate decision tree
   models were used to predict the potential distribution of this species.
   Results Lepidium latifolium infested two zones: near the
   marshland-upland margin and along channels within the marsh.
   Topographical data, which are typically strongly correlated with wetland
   species distributions, were relatively unimportant to L. latifolium
   occurrence, although relevant microtopography information, particularly
   relative elevation, was subsumed in the distance to channel variable.
   The map of potential L. latifolium distribution reveals that Rush Ranch
   contains considerable habitat that it is susceptible to continued
   invasion.
   Main conclusions Lepidium latifolium invades relatively less stressful
   sites along the inundation and salinity gradients. Advanced remote
   sensing datasets were shown to be sufficient for species distribution
   modelling. Remote sensing offers powerful tools that deserve wider use
   in ecological research and management.},

Title = {Harnessing knowledge of animal behavior to improve habitat restoration
   outcomes},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Restoring degraded habitat to increase biodiversity is a global
   challenge. While habitat restoration for animals should lead to
   self-sustaining breeding populations of target species, often this does
   not occur. Understanding the factors constraining progress toward this
   goal and how these constraints can be overcome is vital. We use a review
   to highlight how insights from animal behavior can help plan restoration
   projects, and identify and ameliorate some of the reasons why
   restoration may fail to meet biodiversity goals. We present a decision
   tree to highlight how behavioral knowledge can identify and address two
   ways in which restoration can fail when: (1) target animals do not
   colonize restored sites and (2) they colonize restored sites but
   experience conditions that do not match their habitat requirements.
   Investing in the collection of behavioral information may be difficult
   for management agencies when funding is limited. We highlight when
   behavioral information is likely to be most important, and some of the
   practical considerations for its application in restoration projects. We
   conclude by identifying key knowledge gaps and future directions that
   can improve restoration outcomes for biodiversity by incorporating
   behavioral knowledge. Restoration is needed to ameliorate the effects of
   habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation on fauna. Unfortunately,
   restoration does not always lead to the intended optimal outcomes for
   target animals. A greater consideration of animal behavior and its
   consequences can help during both the planning and evaluation of
   restoration projects. We hope to stimulate dialogue between restoration
   and behavioral ecologists to improve restoration outcomes for animals.},

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Volume = {129},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-280},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper examines how to obtain species biplots in unconstrained or
   constrained ordination without resorting to the Euclidean distance
   {[}used in principal-component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis
   (RDA)] or the chi-square distance {[}preserved in correspondence
   analysis (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] which are not
   always appropriate for the analysis of community composition data. To
   achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables.
   They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA,
   which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while
   circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and
   avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases.
   This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA
   carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e.
   environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial
   analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying
   the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another
   application allows the use of species data in other methods of
   multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function;
   an example is K-means partitioning.},

Abstract = {Pest risk assessment (PRA) comprises a set of quantitative and
   qualitative tools to protect productive ecosystems from the impacts of
   unwanted biological invasions. Self-organizing maps for pest profile
   analysis (SOM PPA) is a methodological approach aimed to support PRA. It
   is based on cluster analysis and extracts information out of current
   distributions of insect crop pests world-wide, allowing the analyst to
   generate a list of potential risk species for a target region.
   Self-organizing maps for pest profile analysis currently lacks of a
   measure of performance able to provide a level of confidence for its
   outputs. In this study, we investigate diversity as an ecologically
   meaningful and generalizable metric of similarity. The application of
   allowed us to quantify and thus reveal different levels of similarity
   across pest profiles. The use of diversity applied to the SOM PPA
   provides an informative measure of uncertainty for the output of SOM
   PPA, thus adding major improvements to the methodology while only
   marginally increasing its complexity.},

Abstract = {Picea schrenkiana var. tianshanica (PSVT) is an endemic tree species in
   Xinjiang, and serves as windbreak and soil consolidation, to ensure the
   stability of ecological environment. To efficiently and quickly grasp
   the ecological status of PSVT and the stability of forest ecosystem, we
   used images of different resolutions (GF-2 (1 m), GF-1 (8 m), GF-1 (16
   m), Landsat 8 (30 m)) combined with field survey data, and performed
   multi-resolution segmentation to select the best segmentation scales.
   Based on the spectrum, texture and terrain factors, the canopy closure
   inversion of PSVT was performed to select the characteristic factors
   suitable. Then, we applied three object-oriented methods (i.e. support
   vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and
   nearest neighbor classification (NNC)) to classify the forest land. The
   result shows that the near-infrared (NIR) band is highly independent and
   makes an important contribution to the optimum index factor (OIF), in
   which the real-time adjustments of segmentation results are made to
   achieve better effect. There is a significant relationship between
   textural features of each band. The canopy closure estimation model
   performs better with a combination of spectral, terrain, and texture
   factors. Compared to CART and NNC models, SVM classification achieved
   better accuracy.},

Abstract = {Large networks of ecological interactions, such as food webs, are
   complex to characterize, be it empirically or theoretically. The former
   requires exhaustive observations, while the latter generally requires
   ample data to be validated. We therefore wondered whether readily
   available data, namely empirically described interactions in a variety
   of ecosystems, could be combined to predict species interactions in data
   deficient ecosystems. To test this, we built a catalogue of biotic
   interactions from a collection of 94 empirical food webs, detailed
   predator-prey interaction databases and interactions from the Global
   Biotic Interactions (GloBI) database. We used an unsupervised machine
   learning method to predict interactions between any given set of taxa,
   given pairwise taxonomic proximity and known consumer and resource sets
   found in the interaction catalogue. Results suggest that pairwise
   interactions can be predicted with high accuracy. While conclusions are
   seemingly dependent on the comprehensiveness of the catalogue, knowledge
   of taxonomy was found to complement well the catalogue and improve
   predictions, especially when empirical information available is scarce.
   Given its high accuracy, this methodology could promote the use of food
   webs and network level descriptors in remote and frontier location where
   empirical data is hard to collect. Network characteristics could then be
   efficiently evaluated and correlated to levels of environmental
   stressors in order to improve vulnerability assessments of ecosystems to
   global changes, opening promising avenues for further research and for
   management initiatives.},

Abstract = {Antarctica is an iconic region for scientific explorations as it is
   remote and a critical component of the global climate system. Recent
   climate change causes a dramatic retreat of ice in Antarctica with
   associated impacts to its coastal ecosystem. These anthropogenic impacts
   have a potential to increase habitat availability for Antarctic
   intertidal assemblages. Assessing the extent and ecological consequences
   of these changes requires us to develop accurate biotic baselines and
   quantitative predictive tools. In this study, we demonstrated that
   satellite-based remote sensing, when used jointly with in situ
   ground-truthing and machine learning algorithms, provides a powerful
   tool to predict the cover and richness of intertidal macroalgae. The
   salient finding was that the Sentinel-based remote sensing described a
   significant proportion of variability in the cover and richness of
   Antarctic macroalgae. The highest performing models were for macroalgal
   richness and the cover of green algae as opposed to the model of brown
   and red algal cover. When expanding the geographical range of the
   ground-truthing, even involving only a few sample points, it becomes
   possible to potentially map other Antarctic intertidal macroalgal
   habitats and monitor their dynamics. This is a significant milestone as
   logistical constraints are an integral part of the Antarctic
   expeditions. The method has also a potential in other remote coastal
   areas where extensive in situ mapping is not feasible.},

Journal = {ECOSPHERE},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the era of big data, ecologists are increasingly relying on
   computational approaches and tools to answer existing questions and pose
   new research questions. These include both software applications (e.g.,
   simulation models, databases and machine learning algorithms) and
   hardware systems (e.g., wireless sensor networks, supercomputing, drones
   and satellites), motivating the need for greater collaboration between
   computer scientists and ecologists. Here, we outline some synergistic
   opportunities for scientists in both disciplines that can be gained by
   building collaborations between the computer science and ecology
   research communities, with a focus on the benefits to ecology
   specifically. We also identify past contributions of computer science to
   ecology, including high-frequency environmental sensor technology,
   advanced supercomputing capacity for ecological modeling, databases for
   long-term and high-frequency datasets, and software programs for
   ecological analyses, to anticipate future potential contributions. These
   examples highlight the power and potential for further integration of
   computer science technology and ideas into the ecological research
   community. Finally, we translate our own experiences working together as
   a team of computer scientists and ecologists over the past decade into a
   conceptual framework with recommendations for supporting productive
   collaborations at the interface of the two disciplines. We specifically
   focus on how to apply best practices of team science for bridging
   computer science and ecology, which we advocate will substantially
   benefit ecology long-term.},

Title = {A performance based consensus approach for predicting spatial extent of

   climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The predicted distribution of the Chinese Windmill Palm (Trachycarpus
   fortunes) was modelled using several algorithms with inputs consisting
   of occurrence information and bioclimatic datasets. A global species
   distribution model was developed and projected into New Zealand to
   provide a visualization of suitability for the species in current and
   future conditions. To ensure model robustness, occurrence data was
   checked for redundancy, spatial auto-correlation and the environmental
   variables checked for cross-correlation and collinearity. The final maps
   predicting suitability resulted from ensembling the predictions of all
   the algorithms. The resulting ensembled maps were weighted based on the
   evaluation parameters AUC, Kappa and TSS. When reclassified into low,
   medium and high suitability categories, results show an expansion of
   high suitability areas accompanied by a reduction of low suitability
   areas for the species. The centroids of the high suitability areas also
   exhibit a general movement towards the Southwest under future climate
   conditions. The range expansion was proportional with the representative
   values of emission trajectories RCPs (2.5, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) used in
   projecting into future conditions. The movement magnitude and direction
   of predicted high suitability area centroids for the palm supports the
   use of the plant as an indicator of climate change.},

Title = {Can AI predict animal movements? Filling gaps in animal trajectories
   using inverse reinforcement learning},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Focal animal sampling and continuous recording of behavior in situ are
   essential in the study of ecology. However, observation gaps and missing
   records are unavoidable because the focal individual can move out of
   sight and recording devices do not always work properly. Using an
   inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, we have developed a
   novel gap-filling method to predict the most likely route that an animal
   would have traveled; within this framework, an algorithm learns a reward
   function from animal trajectories to find the environmental features
   preferred by the animal. We applied this approach to GPS trajectories
   obtained from streaked shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) and provide
   evidence of the advantages of the IRL approach over previously used
   interpolation methods. These advantages are as follows: (1) No
   assumptions about the parametric distribution governing movements are
   needed, (2) no assumptions regarding landscape preferences and
   restrictions are needed, and (3) large spatiotemporal gaps can be
   filled. This work demonstrates how IRL can enhance the ability to fill
   gaps in animal trajectories and construct reward-space maps in
   heterogeneous environments. The proposed methodology can assist movement
   research, which seeks to understand phenomena that are ecologically and
   evolutionarily significant, such as habitat selection and migration.},

Journal = {ECOHEALTH},

Volume = {13},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Emerging infectious disease outbreaks are increasingly suspected to be a
   consequence of human pressures exerted on natural ecosystems.
   Previously, host taxonomic communities have been used as indicators of
   infectious disease emergence, and the loss of their diversity has been
   implicated as a driver of increased presence. The mechanistic details in
   how such pathogen-host systems function, however, may not always be
   explained by taxonomic variation or loss. Here we used machine learning
   and methods based on Gower's dissimilarity to quantify metrics of
   invertebrate functional diversity, in addition to functional groups and
   their taxonomic diversity at sites endemic and non-endemic for the model
   generalist pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of
   Buruli ulcer. Changes in these metrics allowed the rapid categorisation
   of the ecological niche of the mycobacterium's hosts and the ability to
   relate specific host traits to its presence in aquatic ecosystems. We
   found that taxonomic diversity of hosts and overall functional diversity
   loss and evenness had no bearing on the mycobacterium's presence, or
   whether the site was in an endemic area. These findings, however,
   provide strong evidence that generalist environmentally persistent
   bacteria such as M. ulcerans can be associated with specific functional
   traits rather than taxonomic groups of organisms, increasing our
   understanding of emerging disease ecology and origin.},

Title = {Classifying habitat characteristics of wetlands using a self-organizing
   map},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Wetlands are nutrient-rich and biodiverse ecosystems that provide
   habitats for various animals and plants and protect against flooding.
   Classification of wetlands provides information to conservation planners
   and resource managers for ecosystem service determination. Many
   ecological case studies illuminate the self-organizing map (SOM) as a
   robust and powerful data classification and visualization tool. In this
   study, we use the SOM to analyze the habitat characteristics of inland
   wetlands in South Korea. We surveyed the plants, benthic
   macroinvertebrates, and bird species inhabiting 530 nationwide wetlands
   for four years from 2016 to 2019. Nine environmental features, including
   the proportion of urban area, farmland, grassland, a forest within a 1
   km buffer zone, distance from the river and nearest wetland, area,
   perimeter, and average slope of wetland polygons, were used to train the
   SOM and examine the habitat characteristics of the surveyed living
   components. A map size of 10 x 11 pixels was considered for SOM
   training, and the output data were classified into eight clusters. Based
   on the occurrence frequency of the surveyed species group, most species
   were distributed in all clusters, whereas some dominated in specific
   clusters. We believe that our study contributes significantly to the
   literature because it highlights the significance of the SOM approach to
   cluster wetlands with dependent habitats and provides ecological
   information to build sustainable wetland conservation policies.},

Abstract = {Acoustic metrics (AM) assist our interpretation of acoustic environments
   by aggregating a complex signal into a unique number. NumerousAMhave
   been developed for terrestrial ecosystems, with applications ranging
   from rapid biodiversity assessments to characterizing habitat quality.
   However, there has been comparatively little research aimed at
   understanding how these metrics perform to characterize the acoustic
   features of marine habitats and their relation with ecosystem
   biodiversity. Our objectives were to 1) assess whetherAMare able to
   capture the spectral and temporal differences between two distinct
   Antarctic marine acoustic environment types (i.e., pelagic vs.
   on-shelf), 2) evaluate the performance of a combination ofAMcompared to
   the signal full frequency spectrum to characterize marine mammals
   acoustic assemblages (i.e., species richness-SR-and species identity)
   and 3) estimate the contribution ofSRto the local marine acoustic
   heterogeneity measured by singleAM. We used 23 differentAMto develop a
   supervised machine learning approach to discriminate between acoustic
   environments.AMperformance was similar to the full spectrum, achieving
   correct classifications forSRlevels of 58\% and 92\% for pelagic and
   on-shelf sites respectively and > 88\% for species identities. Our
   analyses show that a combination ofAMis a promising approach to
   characterize marine acoustic communities. It allows an intuitive
   ecological interpretation of passive acoustic data, which in the light
   of ongoing environmental changes, supports the holistic approach needed
   to detect and understand trends in species diversity, acoustic
   communities and underwater habitat quality.},

Title = {Spatial patterns of plant functional types and environmental proxies of

Number = {8-9, SI},

Abstract = {The geographical patterns of species richness and underlying mechanisms
   are among the central issues of ecology. The Himalaya, a global
   biodiversity hotspot, lacks spatially explicit representation of plant
   richness patterns and predictor environmental covariates. The rugged
   Himalayan terrain limits large-scale field surveys, we, therefore,
   disentangle the role of remotely sensed environmental proxies for
   characterization of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) and prediction of
   plant richness in an alpine area in WesternHimalaya. Alpine plant
   richness was recorded in cluster plots (10 random quadrants of 1m(2) in
   approximately 1-ha area) across 97 sites in Pithoragarh district in part
   of the Western Himalaya(India). The dominant PFTs were mapped based on
   support vector machine classification of Landsat 8 image.
   Thesatellite-derived climate, landscape,and topographic variables were
   correlated to plant richness using generalized linear model (GLM) with
   poisson distribution to unravel species richness-environment linkages in
   the study area. The dominant PFTs mapped were herbaceous meadow,
   Danthonia grassland, Kobresia sedge meadow, moist scrub, and dry scrub.
   The GLM based plant richness model explained 70\% variation in alpine
   plant richness. The environmental factorssuch as vegetation vigor,
   elevation, landscape diversity and moisturewere observed to influence
   alpine plant richness of the study area. The study presents a valuable
   baseline spatial database for judicious management of alpine plant
   resources and climate change studies.},

Title = {Predicting fundamental and realized distributions based on thermal

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {52-57},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM) have been broadly used in ecology to
   address theoretical and practical problems. Currently, there are two
   main approaches to generate SDMs: (i) correlative, which is based on
   species occurrences and environmental predictor layers and (ii)
   process-based models, which are constructed based on species' functional
   traits and physiological tolerances. The distributions estimated by each
   approach are based on different components of species niche. Predictions
   of correlative models approach species realized niches, while
   predictions of process-based are more akin to species fundamental niche.
   Here, we integrated the predictions of fundamental and realized
   distributions of the freshwater turtle Trachemys dorbigni. Fundamental
   distribution was estimated using data of T. dorbigni's egg incubation
   temperature, and realized distribution was estimated using species
   occurrence records. Both types of distributions were estimated using the
   same regression approaches (logistic regression and support vector
   machines), both considering macroclimatic and microclimatic
   temperatures. The realized distribution of T. dorbigni was generally
   nested in its fundamental distribution reinforcing theoretical
   assumptions that the species' realized niche is a subset of its
   fundamental niche. Both modelling algorithms produced similar results
   but microtemperature generated better results than macrotemperature for
   the incubation model. Finally, our results reinforce the conclusion that
   species realized distributions are constrained by other factors other
   than just thermal tolerances.},

Abstract = {The climate crisis is impacting agroecosystems and threatening food
   security of millions of smallholder farmers. Understanding the potential
   for current and future climatic adaptation of local crop
   agrobiodiversity may guide breeding efforts and support resilience of
   agriculture. Here, we combine a genomic and climatic characterization of
   a large collection of traditional barley varieties from Ethiopia, a
   staple for local smallholder farmers cropping in challenging
   environments. We find that the genomic diversity of barley landraces can
   be partially traced back to geographic and environmental diversity of
   the landscape. We employ a machine learning approach to model Ethiopian
   barley adaptation to current climate and to identify areas where its
   existing diversity may not be well adapted in future climate scenarios.
   We use this information to identify optimal trajectories of assisted
   migration compensating to detrimental effects of climate change, finding
   that Ethiopian barley diversity bears opportunities for adaptation to
   the climate crisis. We then characterize phenology traits in the
   collection in two common garden experiments in Ethiopia, using
   genome-wide association approaches to identify genomic loci associated
   with timing of flowering and maturity of the spike. We combine this
   information with genotype-environment associations finding that loci
   involved in flowering time may also explain environmental adaptation.
   Our data show that integrated genomic, climatic, and phenotypic
   characterizations of agrobiodiversity may provide breeding with
   actionable information to improve local adaptation in smallholder
   farming systems.},

Abstract = {Aim To analyse spatial trade-offs in conservation of mammals,
   considering benefits of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic
   costs.
   Location Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.
   Methods We built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 154 mammals
   inhabiting the cerrado. We combined model projections to produce
   consensus maps of species' distributions for three types of models
   (envelope, statistical and machine-learning models). We used these range
   summaries as input data in spatial prioritization analyses. We compared
   six conservation scenarios, considering human population density, land
   cost, anthropogenic land use, political willingness to act and the
   distribution of species using trade-off analyses. We complemented the
   current network of protected areas, aiming to achieve a target of 17\%
   of land protection in the cerrado.
   Results Species-rich sites coincide with regions with high human
   population, high land cost, high anthropogenic land use and diverse
   levels of political willingness to act. We found a significant change in
   spatial priorities when we included socioeconomic and political
   dimensions in analyses: top-priority sites moved north, reduced by 68\%
   potential conservation conflicts with human population, reduced by 72\%
   the total monetary cost of actions and reduced by 68\% conflict with
   other anthropogenic land uses. It also increased by 80\% the beneficial
   effect of political willingness to act.
   Main conclusions Our results reinforce the idea that using only
   biological criteria for proposing spatial conservation priorities can
   undermine conservation plans given increases in socioeconomic and
   political conflicts.},

Abstract = {Aquatic invasive species pose major ecological and economic threats to
   aquatic ecosystems worldwide via displacement, predation, or
   hybridization with native species and the alteration of aquatic habitats
   and hydrologic cycles. Modeling the habitat suitability of alien aquatic
   species through spatially explicit mapping is an increasingly important
   risk assessment tool. Habitat modeling also facilitates identification
   of key environmental variables influencing invasive species
   distributions. We compared four modeling methods to predict the
   potential continental United States distributions of northern snakehead
   Channa argus (Cantor, 1842), round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas,
   1814), and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844)
   using maximum entropy (Maxent), the genetic algorithm for rule set
   production (GARP), DOMAIN, and support vector machines (SVM). We used
   inventory records from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database
   and a geographic information system of 20 climatic and environmental
   variables to generate individual and ensemble distribution maps for each
   species. The ensemble maps from our study performed as well as or better
   than all of the individual models except Maxent. The ensemble and Maxent
   models produced significantly higher accuracy individual maps than GARP,
   one-class SVMs, or DOMAIN. The key environmental predictor variables in
   the individual models were consistent with the tolerances of each
   species. Results from this study provide insights into which locations
   and environmental conditions may promote the future spread of invasive
   fish in the US.},

Title = {Trophic plasticity of mixotrophic corals under contrasting environments},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2841-2855},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mixotrophic organisms can derive nutrition from both auto- and
   heterotrophy, which allows them to use a variety of trophic pathways to
   sustain their metabolic demands under variable conditions. Therefore,
   when facing environmental change, these organisms are expected to
   demonstrate an intrinsic ability to acclimatize through trophic
   plasticity. Scleractinian corals are ecologically important mixotrophs,
   but understanding their trophic plasticity has been impaired by an
   oversimplification towards inconsistent proxies of coral diet and
   overlooking intraspecific variability. Here, we applied a Bayesian
   analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data to determine the
   trophic niches of six common species of scleractinian corals and their
   associated endosymbionts, and combined it with an unsupervised machine
   learning algorithm to identify trophic behaviours and strategies. We
   found a variable amount of nutritional plasticity identified by
   different trophic behaviours within and between mixotrophic corals
   living under the same environmental conditions. Furthermore, we observed
   changes in trophic plasticity across environmental conditions. Corals
   from variable environments had larger host and endosymbiont niches than
   corals from stable environments. In addition, deeper corals had niches
   indicating a greater degree of heterotrophy than shallow corals.
   Collectively, corals exhibited distinct trophic strategies by promoting
   trophic niche differentiation along the mixotrophic continuum and
   conspecific individual colonies displayed high trophic variation. Our
   results provide a foundation to understand how mixotrophic organisms may
   adjust their nutrition in response to ongoing global environmental
   change and the consequential modification of benthic assemblages.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},

Volume = {172},

Abstract = {Urban land covers (ULC) are essential data for numerous studies of urban
   landscape ecology performed on various scales. Nevertheless, it remains
   difficult to obtain accurate and timely ULC information. This study
   presents a methodological framework for fusing optical and synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) data at the pixel level with manifolds to improve
   ULC classification. Three typical manifold learning models, namely,
   ISOMAP, Local Linear Embedding (LLE) and principle component analysis
   (PCA), were employed, and their results were compared. SPOT-5 data were
   used as optical data to be fused with three different SAR datasets.
   Experimental results showed that 1) the most useful information of the
   optical and SAR data were included in the manifolds with intrinsic
   dimensionality, while various ULC classes were distributed differently
   throughout the feature spaces of manifolds derived from different
   learning methods; 2) in certain cases, ISOMAP performed comparably to
   PCA, but PCA generally performed the best out of all the study cases,
   yielding the best producer's and user's accuracy of all ULC classes and
   requiring the least amount of time to build the machine learning models;
   and 3) the LLE-derived manifolds yielded the lowest accuracy, primarily
   by confusing bare soils with dark impervious surfaces and vegetation.
   These results indicate the effectiveness of the new manifold technology
   to fuse optical and SAR data at the pixel level for improving ULC
   classification, which can be applied in practice to support the accurate
   analysis of urban landscape.},

Title = {Guidelines for the prediction of species interactions through binary
   classification},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Abstract = {1. The prediction of species interactions is gaining momentum as a way
   to circumvent limitations in data volume. Yet, ecological networks are
   challenging to predict because they are typically small and sparse.
   Dealing with extreme class imbalance is a challenge for most binary
   classifiers, and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive
   models can be trained for this specific problem.2. Using simple
   mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a variety of
   classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained on simulated networks,
   we develop a series of guidelines related to the choice of measures to
   use for model selection, and the ways to assemble the training
   dataset.3. Neither classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (ROC- AUC) are informative measures for
   the performance of inter- action prediction. The area under the
   precision-recall curve (PR- AUC) is a fairer assessment of performance.
   In some cases, even standard measures can lead to selecting a more
   biased classifier because the effect of connectance is strong. The
   amount of correction to apply to the training dataset depends on network
   connectance, on the measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the
   classifier.4. These results reveal that training machines to predict
   networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all cases, the
   composition of the training set needs to be fine -tuned before
   performing the actual training. We discuss these consequences in the
   context of the low volume of data.},

Title = {Ecological dynamics of the gut microbiome in response to dietary fiber},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2040-2055},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Dietary fibers are generally thought to benefit intestinal health. Their
   impacts on the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiome,
   however, vary greatly across individuals. Previous research showed that
   each individual's response to fibers depends on their baseline gut
   microbiome, but the ecology driving microbiota remodeling during fiber
   intake remained unclear. Here, we studied the long-term dynamics of the
   gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in isogenic mice with
   distinct microbiota baselines fed with the fermentable fiber inulin and
   resistant starch compared to the non-fermentable fiber cellulose. We
   found that inulin produced a generally rapid response followed by
   gradual stabilization to new equilibria, and those dynamics were
   baseline-dependent. We parameterized an ecology model from the
   time-series data, which revealed a group of bacteria whose growth
   significantly increased in response to inulin and whose baseline
   abundance and interspecies competition explained the baseline dependence
   of microbiome density and community composition dynamics. Fecal levels
   of SCFAs, such as propionate, were associated with the abundance of
   inulin responders, yet inter-individual variation of gut microbiome
   impeded the prediction of SCFAs by machine learning models. We showed
   that our methods and major findings were generalizable to dietary
   resistant starch. Finally, we analyzed time-series data of synthetic and
   natural human gut microbiome in response to dietary fiber and validated
   the inferred interspecies interactions in vitro. This study emphasizes
   the importance of ecological modeling to understand microbiome responses
   to dietary changes and the need for personalized interventions.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity accumulates hierarchically by means of ecological and
   evolutionary processes and feedbacks. Within ecological communities
   drift, dispersal, speciation, and selection operate simultaneously to
   shape patterns of biodiversity. Reconciling the relative importance of
   these is hindered by current models and inference methods, which tend to
   focus on a subset of processes and their resulting predictions. Here we
   introduce massive ecoevolutionary synthesis simulations (MESS), a
   unified mechanistic model of community assembly, rooted in classic
   island biogeography theory, which makes temporally explicit joint
   predictions across three biodiversity data axes: (i) species richness
   and abundances, (ii) population genetic diversities, and (iii) trait
   variation in a phylogenetic context. Using simulations we demonstrate
   that each data axis captures information at different timescales, and
   that integrating these axes enables discriminating among previously
   unidentifiable community assembly models. MESS is unique in generating
   predictions of community-scale genetic diversity, and in characterizing
   joint patterns of genetic diversity, abundance, and trait values. MESS
   unlocks the full potential for investigation of biodiversity processes
   using multidimensional community data including a genetic component,
   such as might be produced by contemporary eDNA or metabarcoding studies.
   We combine MESS with supervised machine learning to fit the parameters
   of the model to real data and infer processes underlying how
   biodiversity accumulates, using communities of tropical trees,
   arthropods, and gastropods as case studies that span a range of data
   availability scenarios, and spatial and taxonomic scales.},

Abstract = {Conservation of exploited species requires an understanding of both
   genetic diversity and the dominant structuring forces, particularly near
   range limits, where climatic variation can drive rapid expansions or
   contractions of geographic range. Here, we examine population structure
   and landscape associations in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) across a
   heterogeneous landscape near the northern range limit in Labrador,
   Canada. Analysis of two amplicon-based data sets containing 101
   microsatellites and 376 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 35
   locations revealed clear differentiation between populations spawning in
   rivers flowing into a large marine embayment (Lake Melville) compared to
   coastal populations. The mechanisms influencing the differentiation of
   embayment populations were investigated using both multivariate and
   machine-learning landscape genetic approaches. We identified temperature
   as the strongest correlate with genetic structure, particularly warm
   temperature extremes and wider annual temperature ranges. The genomic
   basis of this divergence was further explored using a subset of
   locations (n=17) and a 220K SNP array. SNPs associated with spatial
   structuring and temperature mapped to a diverse set of genes and
   molecular pathways, including regulation of gene expression, immune
   response, and cell development and differentiation. The results spanning
   molecular marker types and both novel and established methods clearly
   show climate-associated, fine-scale population structure across an
   environmental gradient in Atlantic salmon near its range limit in North
   America, highlighting valuable approaches for predicting population
   responses to climate change and managing species sustainability.},

Title = {Hierarchical Bayesian models in ecology: Reconstructing species
   interaction networks from non-homogeneous species abundance data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {55-64},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The relationships among organisms and their surroundings can be of
   immense complexity. To describe and understand an ecosystem as a tangled
   bank, multiple ways of interaction and their effects have to be
   considered, such as predation, competition, mutualism and facilitation.
   Understanding the resulting interaction networks is a challenge in
   changing environments, e.g. to predict knock-on effects of invasive
   species and to understand how climate change impacts biodiversity. The
   elucidation of complex ecological systems with their interactions will
   benefit enormously from the development of new machine learning tools
   that aim to infer the structure of interaction networks from field data.
   In the present study, we propose a novel Bayesian regression and
   multiple changepoint model (BRAM) for reconstructing species interaction
   networks from observed species distributions. The model has been devised
   to allow robust inference in the presence of spatial autocorrelation and
   distributional heterogeneity. We have evaluated the model on simulated
   data that combines a trophic niche model with a stochastic population
   model on a 2-dimensional lattice, and we have compared the performance
   of our model with L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear
   Bayesian networks with the BDe scoring scheme. In addition, we have
   applied our method to plant ground coverage data from the western shore
   of the Outer Hebrides with the objective to infer the ecological
   interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change and invasive species are two of the most serious threats
   of biodiversity. A general concern is that these threats interact, and
   that a globally warming climate could favour invasive species. In this
   study we investigate the invasive potential of one of the ``100 of the
   world's worst invasive species{''}, the big-headed ant Pheidole
   megacephala. Using ecological niche models, we estimated the species'
   potential suitable habitat in 2020, 2050 and 2080. With an ensemble
   forecast obtained from five different modelling techniques, 3 Global
   Circulation Models and 2 CO2 emission scenarios, we generated world maps
   with suitable climatic conditions and assessed changes, both
   qualitatively and quantitatively. Almost one-fifth (18.5 \%) of the
   landmass currently presents suitable climatic conditions for P.
   megacephala. Surprisingly, our results also indicate that the invasion
   of big-headed ants is not only unlikely to benefit from climate change,
   but may even suffer from it. Our projections show a global decrease in
   the invasive potential of big-headed ants as early as 2020 and becoming
   even stronger by 2080 reaching a global loss of 19.4 \% of area with
   favourable climate. The decrease is observable in all 6 broad regions,
   being greatest in the Oceania and lowest in Europe.},

Title = {Process-based species delimitation leads to identification of more

Abstract = {Most approaches to species delimitation to date have considered
   divergence-only models. Although these models are appropriate for
   allopatric speciation, their failure to incorporate many of the
   population-level processes that drive speciation, such as gene flow
   (e.g., in sympatric speciation), places an unnecessary limit on our
   collective understanding of the processes that produce biodiversity. To
   consider these processes while inferring species boundaries, we
   introduce the R-package delimitR and apply it to identify species
   boundaries in the reticulate taildropper slug (Prophysaon andersoni).
   Results suggest that secondary contact is an important mechanism driving
   speciation in this system. By considering process, we both avoid
   erroneous inferences that can be made when population-level processes
   such as secondary contact drive speciation but only divergence is
   considered, and gain insight into the process of speciation in
   terrestrial slugs. Further, we apply delimitR to three published
   empirical datasets and find results corroborating previous findings.
   Finally, we evaluate the performance of delimitR using simulation
   studies, and find that error rates are near zero when comparing models
   that include lineage divergence and gene flow for three populations with
   a modest number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; 1500) and
   moderate divergence times (<100,000 generations). When we apply delimitR
   to a complex model set (i.e., including divergence, gene flow, and
   population size changes), error rates are moderate (similar to 0.15;
   10,000 SNPs), and, when present, misclassifications occur among highly
   similar models.},

Title = {Function regression in ecology and evolution: FREE},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response
   variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions)
   rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although
   methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for
   several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare. We
   outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function
   (function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses
   on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function
   regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented,
   including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare
   different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on
   individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees. No single method
   performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given
   data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions
   being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to
   combine or compare fitted models. Function regression allows the direct
   modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance
   distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single
   scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity
   indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers
   support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that
   low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions
   than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more
   informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than
   conventional non-function-valued approaches.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variation in nest temperatures forecasts sex ratio
   skews in a crocodilian with environmental sex determination},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {287},
Number = {1926},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Species displaying temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are
   especially vulnerable to the effects of a rapidly changing global
   climate due to their profound sensitivity to thermal cues during
   development. Predicting the consequences of climate change for these
   species, including skewed offspring sex ratios, depends on understanding
   how climatic factors interface with features of maternal nesting
   behaviour to shape the developmental environment. Here, we measure
   thermal profiles in 86 nests at two geographically distinct sites in the
   northern and southern regions of the American alligator's (Alligator
   mississippiensis) geographical range, and examine the influence of both
   climatic factors and maternally driven nest characteristics on nest
   temperature variation. Changes in daily maximum air temperatures drive
   annual trends in nest temperatures, while variation in individual nest
   temperatures is also related to local habitat factors and microclimate
   characteristics. Without any compensatory nesting behaviours, nest
   temperatures are projected to increase by 1.6-3.7 degrees C by the year
   2100, and these changes are predicted to have dramatic consequences for
   offspring sex ratios. Exact sex ratio outcomes vary widely depending on
   site and emission scenario as a function of the unique
   temperature-by-sex reaction norm exhibited by all crocodilians. By
   revealing the ecological drivers of nest temperature variation in the
   American alligator, this study provides important insights into the
   potential consequences of climate change for crocodilian species, many
   of which are already threatened by extinction.},

Title = {Network connectivity of Minnesota waterbodies and implications for

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Connectivity between waterbodies influences the risk of aquatic invasive
   species (AIS) invasion. Understanding and characterizing the
   connectivity between waterbodies through high-risk pathways, such as
   recreational boats, is essential to develop economical and effective
   prevention intervention to control the spread of AIS. Fortunately, state
   and local watercraft inspection programs are collecting significant data
   that can be used to quantify boater connectivity. We created a series of
   predictive models to capture the patterns of boater movements across all
   lakes in Minnesota, USA. Informed by more than 1.3 million watercraft
   inspection surveys from 2014-2017, we simulated boater movements
   connecting 9182 lakes with a high degree of accuracy. Our predictive
   model accurately predicted 97.36\% of the lake pairs known to be
   connected and predicted 91.01\% of the lake pairs known not to be
   connected. Lakes with high degree and betweenness centrality were more
   likely to be infested with an AIS than lakes with low degree (p < 0.001)
   and centrality (p < 0.001). On average, infested lakes were connected to
   1200 more lakes than uninfested lakes. In addition, boaters that visited
   infested lakes were more likely to visit other lakes, increasing the
   risk of AIS spread to uninfested lakes. The use of the simulated boater
   networks can be helpful for determining the risk of AIS invasion for
   each lake and for developing management tools to assist decision makers
   to develop intervention strategies.},

Title = {Phenology dictates the impact of climate change on geographic
   distributions of six co-occurring North American grasshoppers},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {24},
Pages = {18575-18590},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Throughout the last century, climate change has altered the geographic
   distributions of many species. Insects, in particular, vary in their
   ability to track changing climates, and it is likely that phenology is
   an important determinant of how well insects can either expand or shift
   their geographic distributions in response to climate change.
   Grasshoppers are an ideal group to test the hypothesis that phenology
   correlates with range expansion, given that co-occurring confamilial,
   and even congeneric, species can differ in phenology. Here, I tested the
   hypothesis that early- and late-season species should possess different
   range expansion potentials, as estimated by habitat suitability from
   ecological niche models. I used nine different modeling techniques to
   estimate habitat suitability of six grasshopper species of varying
   phenology under two climate scenarios for the year 2050. My results
   suggest that, of the six species examined here, early-season species
   were more sensitive to climate change than late-season species. The
   three early-season species examined here might shift northward during
   the spring, while the modeled geographic distributions of the three
   late-season species were generally constant under climate change, likely
   because they were pre-adapted to hot and dry conditions. Phenology might
   therefore be a good predictor of how insect distributions might change
   in the future, but this hypothesis remains to be tested at a broader
   scale.},

   fisheries management within a SES framework},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},

Volume = {360},
Pages = {132-149},

Abstract = {Informing fishery management decisions using coupled socio-ecological
   systems (CSES) models requires model construction that captures the
   systems interactions with high precision. Ecological uncertainty in
   fishery models is easily reduced using existing scientific literature,
   but social drivers are often poorly defined or understood. The lack of
   knowledge about fishermen behavior results in inaccurate models of
   questionable utility for fishery managers. We designed and constructed a
   high fidelity agent based model (ABM) using the socio-ecological
   framework that reduces social system uncertainty by capturing complex
   behaviors using data-driven bounded rationality and feedback. The
   resulting generalized ABM of CSES dynamics was instantiated to Pacific
   salmon fisheries at Kenai river in Upper Cook Inlet, Alaska. The
   data-driven model construction fuses multiple data-sets for
   classification of social and ecological fishery regimes into stochastic
   distributions; the agent behaviors were generalized by evolving
   parametrized equations using data-driven machine learning; multiple
   non-trivial metrics on multiple scales verified model's accuracy and
   predictive capacity. The verified model of CSES dynamics at the Kenai
   river revealed recent instability in the dipnet fishery coupled
   dynamics, historic instability in the drift gillnet fishery coupled
   dynamics due to a compensatory and aggressive fishing strategy, and in
   the future the model will be used for scenario-based studies to
   understand the outcomes of alternative management strategies. (C) 2017

Title = {Learning to fly: integrating spatial ecology with unmanned aerial
   vehicle surveys},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of new survey tools such as unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs), the implications of how their spatial deployment
   may interact with species detection errors have not yet been assessed.
   Acknowledging and incorporating these errors are crucial for accurate
   population estimation and improved management. To address this important
   gap in our knowledge, and to discover how flight plans should be
   selected to reduce overall error, we simulated contrasting UAV flight
   surveys over a range of population densities and dispersion patterns
   using different detection errors. We found that if a survey is carried
   out using an individual transect that low and slow flights consistently
   provide the best estimates of abundance and occupancy. However, the
   greater sampling area afforded by higher or faster flights resulted in
   more complex guidelines for estimates of abundance or occupancy over
   larger study areas. For highly clustered populations, especially those
   at low densities, a high and fast survey is preferable, as its greater
   area coverage best enables detection of local occupancy. The performance
   rankings of flight plans were sensitive to the underlying species
   detectability and, to a lesser extent, population density and
   aggregation. This suggests that UAV survey plans need to account for the
   spatial and movement ecology of target species, and that flight plans
   should adapt as an invasive species spreads, or a threatened species
   contracts. We encapsulate our results in a decision tree to guide flight
   planning for given survey objectives, detectability, and ecological
   context. Importantly, these findings provide guidance to other fields
   with transect-based surveys such as manned aviation and road or ground
   transects that trade-off sampling area and precision of estimates.
   Promising new technologies such as UAVs will be best utilized by
   ecologists if detection errors, and their interaction with the spatial
   ecology of the species, are carefully assessed.},

Title = {Changes in land cover and ecological stress in Borneo based on remote
   sensing and an ecological footprint method},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-333},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Changes in land cover and ecological stressors are known to reflect the
   influences of human activities on regional environments and are also
   indicators of sustainable development. In this research, Borneo was
   selected as the study area. The data were sourced from Landsat TM image
   data obtained in 1990, 2000 and 2010, SRTM DEM data, and DMSP/OLS
   night-time satellite data, along with socioeconomic information,
   including regional population, biological resource consumption and
   energy consumption data. The vegetation brightness index (VBI) and the
   filtered normalized difference built-up index (FNDBI) are proposed, and
   the overall classification accuracy reached 87\% when combined with
   decision tree classification and visual interpretation methods. Based on
   the traditional ecological footprint method, a dynamic calculation
   method for the production factor is proposed. The ecological footprint,
   ecological carrying capacity, and ecological deficit/surplus of Borneo
   in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were then calculated, and a method for creating
   the corresponding grid-based spatial distribution map was proposed. The
   effects of human activities on land cover and ecological stress in
   Borneo from 1990 to 2010 were analyzed in this study. The results showed
   that the tropical rainforests of Borneo decreased by 13\% over two
   decades and dramatically changed to shrublands, plantations, and arable
   land areas. The ecological pressure increased from the central mountains
   to the coastal plains, and ecological deficits appeared in the coastal
   zones with altitudes less than 150 m in the West Kalimantan, South
   Kalimantan, and Sabah regions, which indicated a trend of gradual
   expansion. Urban construction, plantations, logging, mining, forest
   fires, and other human activities have interfered with natural systems,
   and this has led to major pressures being placed on regional sustainable
   development and ecological security, as well as influencing the
   ecological stability of other global regions.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1763-1774},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Large-scale ecological surveillance data were analysed to determine the
   locations of apparent eutrophication effects across common British
   vegetation types between 1990 and 1998. Plant species composition was
   recorded from a total of 9514 fixed plots located in a stratified,
   random sample of 501 1 km squares across Britain. Changes in plant
   species composition along a gradient of substrate fertility were
   inferred from statistical tests of change in mean Ellenberg fertility
   value calculated for each fixed plot. Plots were grouped by eight
   vegetation types, five landscape features (hedges, road verges,
   watercourse banks, small biotopes, larger units in fields and unenclosed
   land) and six environmental zones. Tests of change in mean Ellenberg
   value were carried out on all combinations of these strata. Decision
   tree modelling was used to identify groups of test outcomes sharing the
   same direction of change and where each group was defined by a minimum
   number of strata. Post hoc power analysis was used to select
   statistically non-significant test outcomes that could be used to infer
   stability in the sampled sub-population.
   Out of a total of 142 tests of change in fertility value, 67\% were
   increases, 8\% were reductions and 25\% indicated stability. The best
   overall predictor of increases in fertility value, and therefore of
   shifts in favour of plants suited to higher substrate fertility, was
   vegetation type. Irrespective of landscape feature and environmental
   zone, increased means were associated with infertile grasslands,
   moorland, upland woodlands and heath/bog. Already highly fertile
   grasslands and woodland assemblages in lowland Britain remained largely
   stable. The small number of decreasing test outcomes were associated
   with arable land in Scotland, Wales and western England. These patterns
   of change are hypothesized to reflect pervasive land-use drivers
   combined with the inherent responsiveness of the vegetation.},

Title = {Designing weed containment strategies: An approach based on
   feasibilities of eradication and containment},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {555-566},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Aim
   To refine strategies for the containment of weed invasions.
   Location
   World-wide, but primarily Australia and Galapagos Islands.
   Methods
   By employing theoretical and semi-quantitative models, we estimated
   conditions under which barrier zones should be established and
   maintained around core infestations and when eradication of outliers
   should be attempted. Reference was made to published information on
   generic dispersal distances and the biological characteristics of a wide
   variety of weeds, including the targets of well-documented successful
   and failed eradication programmes.
   Results
   When weeds generate fat-tailed dispersal distance distributions having
   relatively high median values, search efficiency will be compromised if
   barrier zones are employed. The theoretical model developed supports the
   non-use of barrier zones in management strategies targeting tree weeds
   that are predominantly wind dispersed, or any species that are dispersed
   by birds or larger wild mammals. Many weeds that have major impacts on
   natural ecosystems fall within these categories. Eradication of outliers
   generally should not be considered where weeds have short juvenile
   phases and long-lived seeds. Four containment substrategies are
   distinguished on the basis of whether barrier zones around core
   infestations are established and whether the eradication of outliers is
   attempted. The suitability of individual substrategies is indicated for
   weeds of a variety of growth forms, occurring in a range of land uses,
   and a decision tree is presented for categorical assignment.
   Main conclusions
   A structured approach to the development of weed containment strategies
   will help to promote the efficient use of limited resources. Targeted
   species vary according to both the relative ease with which core
   populations can be contained and outlier populations eradicated -
   containment strategies should be designed accordingly. This study shows
   that semi-quantitative models can be powerful adjuncts to their
   theoretical counterparts in support of decision-making for the
   management of weed invasions.},

Title = {Potential Misuse of Avian Density as a Conservation Metric},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Effective conservation metrics are needed to evaluate the success of
   management in a rapidly changing world. Reproductive rates and densities
   of breeding birds (as a surrogate for reproductive rate) have been used
   to indicate the quality of avian breeding habitat, but the underlying
   assumptions of these metrics rarely have been examined. When birds are
   attracted to breeding areas in part by the presence of conspecifics and
   when breeding in groups influences predation rates, the effectiveness of
   density and reproductive rate as indicators of habitat quality is
   reduced. It is beneficial to clearly distinguish between individual- and
   population-level processes when evaluating habitat quality. We use the
   term reproductive rate to refer to both levels and further distinguish
   among levels by using the terms per capita fecundity (number of female
   offspring per female per year, individual level) and population growth
   rate (the product of density and per capita fecundity, population
   level). We predicted how density and reproductive rate interact over
   time under density-independent and density-dependent scenarios, assuming
   the ideal free distribution model of how birds settle in breeding
   habitats. We predicted population density of small populations would be
   correlated positively with both per capita fecundity and population
   growth rate due to the Allee effect. For populations in the
   density-dependent growth phase, we predicted no relation between density
   and per capita fecundity (because individuals in all patches will
   equilibrate to the same success rate) and a positive relation between
   density and population growth rate. Several ecological theories
   collectively suggest that positive correlations between density and per
   capita fecundity would be difficult to detect. We constructed a decision
   tree to guide interpretation of positive, neutral, nonlinear, and
   negative relations between density and reproductive rates at individual
   and population levels.},

Title = {Communicating changes in state of the southern Benguela ecosystem using
   trophic, model-derived indicators},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {512},
Pages = {217-237},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {An updated trophic model of the southern Benguela ecosystem in the
   period 2004-2008 was constructed, complementing trophic models for
   earlier periods. The model represents the trophic structure of the
   system after a southward shift of major resources. There was an increase
   in biomass of small pelagic fish and cephalopods between the 1980s and
   2004-2008 periods, accompanied by declines in several higher trophic
   level groups. A 3 step process was followed: (1) a series of snapshots
   of the ecosystem was used to explore changes in the food web structure
   over time, (2) trophic indicators were extracted from these models to
   detect changes, and (3) model-derived ecological indicators which were
   deemed most meaningful for management within the ecosystem were selected
   for use in decision trees, providing a logical framework in which to
   access synthesised information on trends in ecosystem status as a result
   of fishing. Three decision trees were developed which examined the
   ecosystem at the community level (pelagic-caught fish and
   demersal-caught fish community decision trees) and at the system level
   (ecosystem decision tree). The decision trees classified one period of
   the southern Benguela ecosystem as `Deteriorating' (the period after the
   onset of industrial fishing: 1960s vs. 1900s), and 3 periods as `Not
   improving' (1980s vs. 1960s, 1990s vs. 1980s, and 2004-2008 vs. 1980s).
   The current management strategy has ensured that the offshore southern
   Benguela ecosystem has not deteriorated further since the 1960s in terms
   of ecosystem functioning and at the scale of the fish community.
   Although the decision trees are conservative with regard to trends, the
   logic they employ is sound and robust, providing fisheries managers with
   a coherent framework to access synthesised information and the reasoning
   behind conclusions reached.},

Title = {Modelling pre-clearing vegetation distribution using GIS-integrated

Abstract = {Traditional vegetation mapping methods use high cost, labour-intensive
   aerial photography interpretation. This approach can be subjective and
   is limited by factors such as the extent of remnant vegetation, and the
   differing scale and quality of aerial photography over time. An
   alternative approach is proposed which integrates a data model, a
   statistical model and an ecological model using sophisticated Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) techniques and rule-based systems to support
   fine-scale vegetation community modelling. This approach is based on a
   more realistic representation of vegetation patterns with transitional
   gradients from one vegetation community to another. Arbitrary, though
   often unrealistic, sharp boundaries can be imposed on the model by the
   application of statistical methods. This GIS-integrated multivariate
   approach is applied to the problem of vegetation mapping in the complex
   vegetation communities of the Innisfail Lowlands in the Wet Tropics
   bioregion of Northeastern Australia. The paper presents the full cycle
   of this vegetation modelling approach including sampling sites, variable
   selection, model selection, model implementation, internal model
   assessment, model prediction assessments, models integration of discrete
   vegetation community models to generate a composite pre-clearing
   vegetation map, independent data set model validation and model
   prediction's scale assessments. An accurate pre-clearing vegetation map
   of the Innisfail Lowlands was generated (0.83r(2)) through GIS
   integration of 28 separate statistical models. This modelling approach
   has good potential for wider application, including provision of. vital
   information for conservation planning and management; a scientific basis
   for rehabilitation of disturbed and cleared areas; a viable method for
   the production of adequate vegetation maps for conservation and forestry
   planning of poorly-studied areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Conflicting and Complementary Ethics of Animal Welfare Considerations in
   Reintroductions},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {486-500},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite differences in focus, goals, and strategies between conservation
   biology and animal welfare, both are inextricably linked in many ways,
   and greater consideration of animal welfare, although important in its
   own right, also has considerable potential to contribute to conservation
   success. Nevertheless, animal welfare and animal ethics are not always
   considered explicitly within conservation practice. We systematically
   reviewed the recent scientific peer-reviewed and online gray literature
   on reintroductions of captive-bred and wild-caught animals (mammals,
   birds, amphibians, and reptiles) to quantify the occurrence of animal
   welfare issues. We considered monitoring that could be indicative of the
   animal's welfare status and supportive management actions that could
   improve animal welfare (regardless of whether the aim was explicitly
   animal-welfare orientated). Potential welfare issues (of variable nature
   and extent) were recorded in 67\% of 199 projects reviewed; the most
   common were mortality >50\%, dispersal or loss of animals, disease, and
   human conflict. Most (>70\%) projects monitored survival, 18\% assessed
   body condition, and 2\% monitored stress levels. Animal welfare,
   explicitly, was referred to in 6\% of projects. Supportive actions, most
   commonly use of on-site prerelease pens and provision of supplemental
   food or water, were implemented in 79\% of projects, although the extent
   and duration of support varied. Practitioners can address animal-welfare
   issues in reintroductions by considering the potential implications for
   individual animals at all stages of the release process using the
   decision tree presented. We urge practitioners to report potential
   animal-welfare issues, describe mitigation actions, and evaluate their
   efficacy to facilitate transparent evaluation of common moral dilemmas
   and to advance communal strategies for dealing with them. Currently,
   comparative mortality rates, health risks, postrelease stress,
   effectiveness of supportive measures, and behavior of individuals
   warrant further research to improve animal welfare in reintroductions
   and to increase success of such projects.},

Title = {Fish density estimation using unbaited cameras: Accounting for
   environmental-dependent detectability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {527},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The fast development of camera technologies opens a breakthrough
   opportunity for animal ecology, particularly at the marine realm where
   observing wildlife is challenging. These outstanding technological
   advances are meeting with the impressive capabilities of artificial
   intelligence for enabling automatic extraction of relevant information
   from videos and images. Altogether, this may be a unique opportunity for
   a qualitative jump in marine wildlife assessment but substantial
   strengthening of the links between theorists, empiricists and engineers
   is still required. Specifically, a recent theory proposes that animal
   density can be estimated from (1) the counted animals per frame, (2) the
   area surveyed by the camera and (3) the probability of detecting an
   animal that is actually within the area surveyed by the camera. However,
   a potential drawback for applying this theory to the real world is that
   environmental dependencies of camera's detection probability may lead to
   biased estimates of animal density. Therefore, here we propose a
   sampling protocol and a statistical model of general application for
   estimating (and accounting for) the environmental factors affecting fish
   detectability when estimating fish density with cameras. The method
   implies one calibration sampling with cameras and with the preferred
   reference method at the same time and place. The relevance of this
   method is that, once calibrated, it can be used to obtain unbiased
   estimates of fish density at new sites and moments using only cameras.
   Thus, fish density could be estimated at the temporal and the spatial
   scale needed, but with substantially less cost-effort than any other
   reference methods (e.g., underwater visual censuses). As a proof of
   concept, we evaluated the dependence of camera's detection probability
   on habitat complexity (e.g., cavities, rocks, seagrass, etc.) as a proxy
   for the hiding capability of a small serranid. In that specific case,
   probability of detection seems to be independent of habitat complexity.
   However, the sampling protocol and the statistical model provided here
   open the opportunity to estimate fish density using underwater cameras
   at wider temporal and/or spatial scales, which will help to better
   understanding the ultimate drivers of marine fish population dynamics
   and further development of science-based management.},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The increasing importance of individual-based modelling (IBM) in
   population dynamics has led to the greater availability of tools
   designed to facilitate their creation and use. Yet, these tools are
   either too general, requiring the extensive knowledge of a computer
   language, or conversely restricted to very specific applications. Hence,
   they are of little help to non-computer expert ecologists. In order to
   build IBM's without hard coding them nor restricting their scope too
   much, we suggest a component programming, assuming that each elementary
   task that forms the behaviour of an individual often follows the same
   path: an individual must locate and select information in order for it
   to be processed, then he must update his state, the state of other
   individuals, or the state of the rest of the `world'. This sequence is
   well suited to translation into elementary computerised components, that
   we call primitives. Conversely, task building will involve stringing out
   well-chosen primitives and setting their parameter values or
   mathematical formulae. In order to restrict the number of primitives and
   to simplify their use, `information' must be carried through well
   defined structures. We suggest the use of the multi-agents system
   paradigm (MAS) which originates from the distributed artificial
   intelligence and defines agents as autonomous objects that perceive and
   react to their environment. If one assumes that a model can be described
   entirely with the help of agents, then primitives only handle agents,
   agent state or history. This greatly simplifies their conception and
   enhances their flexibility. Indeed, only 25 primitives, split into six
   groups (locate, select, translate, compute, end, and workflow control)
   proved to be sufficient to build complex IBM's or cellular automata
   drawn from literature. Furthermore, such a primitive-based multi-agents
   architecture is very flexible and facilitates all the steps of the
   modelling process, in particular the simulation engine (agents call and
   synchronisation), the results analysis, and the simulation experiments.
   Component programming may also facilitate the design of a domain
   specific language in which these models could be written and exported to
   other simulation platforms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Towards a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {105-138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rapid changes of the biosphere observed in recent years are caused by
   both small and large scale drivers, like shifts in temperature,
   transformations in land-use, or changes in the energy budget of systems.
   While the latter processes are easily quantifiable, documentation of the
   loss of biodiversity and community structure is more difficult. Changes
   in organismal abundance and diversity are barely documented. Censuses of
   species are usually fragmentary and inferred by often spatially,
   temporally and ecologically unsatisfactory simple species lists for
   individual study sites. Thus, detrimental global processes and their
   drivers often remain unrevealed. A major impediment to monitoring
   species diversity is the lack of human taxonomic expertise that is
   implicitly required for large-scale and fine-grained assessments.
   Another is the large amount of personnel and associated costs needed to
   cover large scales, or the inaccessibility of remote but nonetheless
   affected areas.
   To overcome these limitations we propose a network of Automated
   Multisensor stations for Monitoring of species Diversity (AMMODs) to
   pave the way for a new generation of biodiversity assessment centers.
   This network combines cutting-edge technologies with biodiversity
   informatics and expert systems that conserve expert knowledge. Each
   AMMOD station combines autonomous samplers for insects, pollen and
   spores, audio recorders for vocalizing animals, sensors for volatile
   organic compounds emitted by plants (pVOCs) and camera traps for mammals
   and small invertebrates. AMMODs are largely self-containing and have the
   ability to pre-process data (e.g. for noise filtering) prior to
   transmission to receiver stations for storage, integration and analyses.
   Installation on sites that are difficult to access require a
   sophisticated and challenging system design with optimum balance between
   power requirements, bandwidth for data transmission, required service,
   and operation under all environmental conditions for years. An important
   prerequisite for automated species identification are databases of DNA
   barcodes, animal sounds, for pVOCs, and images used as training data for
   automated species identification. AMMOD stations thus become a key
   component to advance the field of biodiversity monitoring for research
   and policy by delivering biodiversity data at an unprecedented spatial
   and temporal resolution. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf

Title = {Investigating spatial non-stationary environmental effects on the
   distribution of giant pandas in the Qinling Mountains, China},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Analyses of species distribution have commonly been performed with
   global regression models by assuming species-environment interactions
   are spatially stationary. However, environmental variables are often
   spatially heterogeneous and their effects on species distribution may
   vary across space. Here we employed a geographically weighted logistic
   regression (logistic GWR) to investigate environmental effects on the
   distribution of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in the Qinling
   Mountains of China. Outputs from the logistic GWR were compared with
   those derived from a global logistic regression in predicting panda
   distribution. A k-means cluster analysis was used to identify distinct
   zones of panda-environment relationships. We found that logistic GWR
   outperformed global logistic regression in terms of goodness-of-fit and
   predictive accuracy. Results from the logistic GWR model clearly showed
   both the strength and direction of the environmental effects on panda
   distribution changed spatially and formed distinct subareas with
   particular panda-environment relationships. The findings emphasize the
   importance of considering spatial non-stationarity in studying
   ecological relationships between organisms and their environments,
   especially for threatened species such as the giant panda with small
   populations in highly fragmented habitats. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Listening to ecosystems: data-rich acoustic monitoring through
   landscape-scale sensor networks},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-147},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ecologists have many ways to measure and monitor ecosystems, each of
   which can reveal details about the processes unfolding therein. Acoustic
   recording combined with machine learning methods for species detection
   can provide remote, automated monitoring of species richness and
   relative abundance. Such recordings also open a window into how species
   behave and compete for niche space in the sensory environment. These
   opportunities are associated with new challenges: the volume and
   velocity of such data require new approaches to species identification
   and visualization. Here we introduce a newly-initiated acoustic
   monitoring network across the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan, as
   part of the broader OKEON (Okinawa Environmental Observation Network)
   project. Our aim is to monitor the acoustic environment of Okinawa's
   ecosystems and use these space-time data to better understand ecosystem
   dynamics. We present a pilot study based on recordings from five field
   sites conducted over a one-month period in the summer. Our results
   provide a proof of concept for automated species identification on
   Okinawa, and reveal patterns of biogenic vs. anthropogenic noise across
   the landscape. In particular, we found correlations between forest land
   cover and detection rates of two culturally important species in the
   island soundscape: the Okinawa Rail and Ruddy Kingfisher. Among the
   soundscape indices we examined, NDSI, Acoustic Diversity and the
   Bioacoustic Index showed both diurnal patterns and differences among
   sites. Our results highlight the potential utility of remote acoustic
   monitoring practices that, in combination with other methods can provide
   a holistic picture of biodiversity. We intend this project as an open
   resource, and wish to extend an invitation to researchers interested in
   scientific collaboration.},

Abstract = {Landscape planning that ensures the ecological integrity of ecosystems
   is critical in the face of rapid human-driven habitat conversion and
   development pressure. Wildlife tracking data provide unique and valuable
   information on animal distribution and location-specific behaviors that
   can serve to increase the efficacy of such planning. Given the
   spatiotemporal complexity inherent to animal movements, the interaction
   between movement behavior and a location is often oversimplified in
   commonly applied analyses of tracking data. We analyzed
   GPS-tracking-derived metrics of intensity of use, structural properties
   (based on network theory), and properties of the movement path (speed
   and directionality) with machine learning to define homogeneous spatial
   movement types. We applied our approach to a long-term tracking data set
   of over 130 African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in an area under
   pressure from infrastructure development. We identified 5 unique
   location-specific movement categories displayed by elephants, generally
   defined as high, medium, and low use intensity, and 2 types of
   connectivity corridors associated with fast and slow movements. High-use
   and slow-movement corridors were associated with similar landscape
   characteristics associated with productive areas near water, whereas
   low-use and fast corridors were characterized by areas of low
   productivity farther from water. By combining information on intensity
   of use, properties of movement paths, and structural aspects of movement
   across the landscape, our approach provides an explicit definition of
   the functional role of areas for movement across the landscape that we
   term the movescape. This combined, high-resolution information regarding
   wildlife space use offers mechanistic information that can improve
   landscape planning.},

Title = {ForestTemp - Sub-canopy microclimate temperatures of European forests},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {6307-6319},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ecological research heavily relies on coarse-gridded climate data based
   on standardized temperature measurements recorded at 2 m height in open
   landscapes. However, many organisms experience environmental conditions
   that differ substantially from those captured by these macroclimatic
   (i.e. free air) temperature grids. In forests, the tree canopy functions
   as a thermal insulator and buffers sub-canopy microclimatic conditions,
   thereby affecting biological and ecological processes. To improve the
   assessment of climatic conditions and climate-change-related impacts on
   forest-floor biodiversity and functioning, high-resolution temperature
   grids reflecting forest microclimates are thus urgently needed.
   Combining more than 1200 time series of in situ near-surface forest
   temperature with topographical, biological and macroclimatic variables
   in a machine learning model, we predicted the mean monthly offset
   between sub-canopy temperature at 15 cm above the surface and free-air
   temperature over the period 2000-2020 at a spatial resolution of 25 m
   across Europe. This offset was used to evaluate the difference between
   microclimate and macroclimate across space and seasons and finally
   enabled us to calculate mean annual and monthly temperatures for
   European forest understories. We found that sub-canopy air temperatures
   differ substantially from free-air temperatures, being on average 2.1
   degrees C (standard deviation +/- 1.6 degrees C) lower in summer and 2.0
   degrees C higher (+/- 0.7 degrees C) in winter across Europe.
   Additionally, our high-resolution maps expose considerable microclimatic
   variation within landscapes, not captured by the gridded macroclimatic
   products. The provided forest sub-canopy temperature maps will enable
   future research to model below-canopy biological processes and patterns,
   as well as species distributions more accurately.},

Title = {Maintaining functional connectivity in grassland corridors between
   plantation forests promotes high-quality habitat and conserves range
   restricted grasshoppers},

Abstract = {Context Grassland corridors are set aside for biodiversity conservation
   within the commercial timber plantation landscape of South Africa,
   potentially connecting high value conservation areas together. However,
   the impact of the production landscape on functional connectivity within
   these corridors has not been investigated. Objectives We combine stacked
   species distribution modelling, functional connectivity analysis,
   species turnover calculations, and community analysis, to improve our
   understanding of how grassland corridors contribute to functional
   connectivity and biodiversity conservation within plantation landscapes.
   Methods Grasshoppers, which are reliable indicators of grassland
   quality, were used as model organisms and sampled within grassland
   corridors. Remote sensing and machine learning was used to predict
   functional connectivity and its influence on grasshoppers. Results Wide
   corridors along an elevation gradient with different aspects support
   different grasshopper assemblages and promote species turnover.
   Sensitive species occur at high elevations with a north-west facing
   slope in wide corridors that are functionally connected to large
   high-quality remnant patches. Maintenance of functional connectivity is
   dependent on the availability of high-quality habitat, which is shaped
   by prescribed burning, and has a significant effect on range restricted
   species. Not all high-quality habitat is functionally connected,
   attributed to exclusion of fire and/or invasive plants, requiring
   conservation intervention. Conclusions Prescribed burning should be used
   to maintain functional connectivity. We recommend less frequent fires,
   burning every 2-3 years, guided by NDVI. Large corridors at high
   elevation are priority. In estates with narrow corridors and low
   functional connectivity, stepping-stone habitats and grassland buffers
   next to roads should be considered for improved functional connectivity.},

Title = {Zoning Seagrass Protection in Lap An Lagoon, Vietnam Using a Novel
   Integrated Framework for Sustainable Coastal Management},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Seagrass is a key factor of the nature-based solution to climate change
   impacts, however, this resource has been lost and degraded worldwide in
   both of area and habitats. Protection of extant seagrass often requires
   a zoning approach to fit the local conditions and to identify the
   spatial prioritization. In this study, we integrated the
   state-of-the-art machine learning model (CatBoost) and Sentinel-2
   multi-spectral imagery for mapping the extent of seagrass meadows,
   combined with the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), fuzzy logic
   (Sigmoidal membership function), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
   technique in a GIS database to score the ecological protection zoning of
   seagrass ecosystem in Lap An lagoon, Vietnam. Seagrass map retrieved
   from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery was used as the constrain factor,
   whilst salinity, water depth, substratum, and distance to aquaculture
   sites were conditioning factors. Our results presented accurate mapping
   of seagrass meadows in the study site (scores of overall accuracy,
   precision, and F-1 are 0.93, 0.90 and 0.92, respectively) and indicated
   22.05 ha (scores 0.66-0.99) in high, 18.63 ha (scores 0.33-0.66) in
   medium, and 10.80 ha (scores 0-0.33) in low priority of protection in
   the southern and the eastern southwest parts of the lagoon, and the
   areas closed to the aquaculture sites, respectively. Our novel
   integrated approach to map the priority zones is useful for sustainable
   protection and management of seagrass meadows and provides a framework
   to strengthen the application of remote sensing and GIS-based techniques
   for further conservation of seagrass globally.},

Title = {Phytosociological and niche distribution study of Paris polyphylla

Abstract = {The prediction of species distribution is emerging as an important tool
   for conservation and rehabilitation planning of economically important
   plant species including medicinal and aromatic plants. Paris polyphylla,
   an economically and high valued medicinal plant of Indian Himalayan
   Region (IHR) is reported to lose its habitat area due to
   over-exploitation. In this study, attempts were made to understand
   vegetation pattern and find the potential distribution of Paris
   polyphylla, using MaxEnt in Pindar Valley (2000-4000 m ASL), Bageshwar
   district of Uttarakhand state, India. MaxEnt is a machine learning data
   mining technique that estimates a species distribution by finding the
   distribution of maximum entropy, based on existing knowledge.
   Phytosociological studies revealed the varying density of target species
   ranging from 0.50 ind/m(2) (P1; 2000 m asl) to 2.00 ind/m(2) (P6; 2500 m
   asl). Among the different geographical provinces of Uttarakhand, MaxEnt
   predicted wider potential distribution of P. polyphylla in temperate
   forest with an overall estimated area of 790.85 km(2) as suitable. It
   was found that Precipitation, Elevation and Vegetation type were the
   most important variables for predicting the habitat suitability. Dwali
   (ca. 2500 m ASL) site was predicted as a potential distribution area of
   P. polyphylla with ground-based validation and further suggested this
   area as a potential reintroduction site. The results of this study can
   be used to plan protection and re-introduction of P. polyphylla in the
   region. MaxEnt approach is thus a very promising tool in species
   conservation planning and in predicting the potential distribution of
   other high valued medicinal plants of IHR.},

Title = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions - Influencing factors, data collection and
   research methods},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) are caused by the close interaction
   of human and wildlife habitats worldwide. The large number of globally
   distributed accidents and the variety of environmental impacts
   characterize WVCs as intricate and challenging to predict. However,
   numerous research studies have been conducted to understand the causal
   relationships between drivers, animals, and the environment. In this
   paper, 645 publications are reviewed to provide an overview and a
   wide-ranging knowledge about WVC research. The study gathers the
   influencing factors on WVCs, systematizes the approaches for data
   collection, and identifies the main developments in analysis and
   predicting methods for WVCs. Factors such as the proximity to forest, a
   gentle topography with sparsely curves, street width, and seasonal
   differences are common denominators for WVCs - independent of the
   species -, while traffic volume, the distance to urban areas, or road
   accompanying infrastructure are not clearly assignable influencing or
   non-influencing factors. Different ways of data collection are observed,
   which range from carcass surveys by ecologists or crowdsourcing for
   species conservation to nearly real-time official reporting by involved
   parties as a basis for driving safety. Data collection and quality are
   discussed for their applicability, in particular, regarding the
   currently used analysing approaches for WVCs. Additionally, the
   advantages of the rarely employed machine learning approaches are
   discussed in terms of dynamic WVC risk prediction - including
   large-scale and temporally unrestricted transferability. These
   approaches may be helpful for prospective warning and road safety
   management on a global scale.},

Title = {Predicting spawning locations and modelling the spatial extent of post
   hatch areas for fishes in a shallow coastal habitat in South Africa},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {560},
Pages = {223-235},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Early studies within Algoa Bay, temperate South Africa, have predicted
   that coastal fish species with pelagic eggs spawn offshore. More recent
   studies on larval fish assemblages in the nearshore have shown that
   spawning may take place closer to shore based on the prevalence of
   preflexion larvae. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   whether species that are important from a fishery and ecological
   perspective are potentially spawning in Algoa Bay. Larval fish abundance
   data, from a mosaic of coastal habitats in Algoa Bay, were used to model
   (1) the spatial distribution of larvae and (2) the spawning location of
   species. A novel approach using a maximum entropy machine-learning
   algorithm to model larval distribution was coupled with reverse
   progressive vector plots (RPVPs) to predict potential spawning areas.
   The results demonstrated that larval fishes in the nearshore habitats of
   Algoa Bay exhibit species-specific spatial variability. Results from
   RPVPs indicate that larvae occurring at any location within Algoa Bay
   could be hatched and transported extensively within the bay before
   reaching a suitable size to swim independently of nearshore currents.
   The spawning of several important fishery species, namely Engraulis
   encrasicolus (Engraulidae), Sardinops sagax (Clupeidae) and Argyrosomus
   inodorus (Sciaenidae), was modelled in Algoa Bay. Our results indicate
   that spawning occurs closer to shore than what was previously thought.
   Eggs and larvae typically remained in close proximity to their spawning
   origin. Larval fish distributions, although variable amongst all study
   species, correspond to known adult distributions and potential reef
   habitats in the study region.},

   impacts on habitat suitability of Madrean Pine-Oak trees},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions are
   expected to globally impact the biological function, community
   structure, and spatial distribution of biodiversity. Many existing
   studies explore the effect of climate change on biodiversity, generally
   at a single spatial scale. This study explores the potential effects of
   climate change on the habitat suitability of seven tree species at two
   distinct spatial scales: the Coronado National Forest (CNF), a local
   management area, and the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), an ecoregional
   extent. Habitat suitability was determined by extrapolating Ecological
   Niche Models (ENMs) based on citizen-science tree occurrence records
   into future climatic conditions using projected 30-year normals for two
   anthropogenic emissions scenarios through the end of the century. These
   ENMs, examined at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2), are constructed using
   a mean average ensemble of three commonly used machine learning
   algorithms. The results show that habitat suitability is expected to
   decrease for all seven tree species at varying degrees. Results also
   show that climate-forcing scenario choice appears to be far less
   important for understanding changes in species habitat suitability than
   the spatial scale of modeling extent. Additionally, we observed
   non-linear changes in tree species habitat suitability within the SMO
   and CNF dependent on forest community type, latitude, and elevational
   gradient. The paper concludes with a discussion of the necessary steps
   to verify the estimated alters of these tree species under climate
   change. Most importantly, provides a framework for characterizing
   habitat suitability across spatial scales.},

Title = {Disgust in animals and the application of disease avoidance to wildlife
   management and conservation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Disgust is an adaptive system hypothesized to have evolved to reduce the
   risk of becoming sick. It is associated with behavioural, cognitive and
   physiological responses tuned to allow animals to avoid and/or get rid
   of parasites, pathogens and toxins. Little is known about the mechanisms
   and outcomes of disease avoidance in wild animals. Furthermore, given
   the escalation of negative human-wildlife interactions, the translation
   of such knowledge into the design of evolutionarily relevant
   conservation and wildlife management strategies is becoming urgent.
   Contemporary methods in animal ecology and related fields, using direct
   (sensory cues) or indirect (remote sensing technologies and machine
   learning) means, provide a flexible toolbox for testing and applying
   disgust at individual and collective levels. In this review/perspective
   paper, we provide an empirical framework for testing the adaptive
   function of disgust and its associated disease avoidance behaviours
   across species, from the least to the most social, in different
   habitats. We predict various trade-offs to be at play depending on the
   social system and ecology of the species. We propose five contexts in
   which disgust-related avoidance behaviours could be applied, including
   endangered species rehabilitation, invasive species, crop-raiding, urban
   pests and animal tourism. We highlight some of the perspectives and
   current challenges of testing disgust in the wild. In particular, we
   recommend future studies to consider together disease, predation and
   competition risks. We discuss the ethics associated with disgust
   experiments in the above contexts. Finally, we promote the creation of a
   database gathering disease avoidance evidence in animals and its
   applications.},

Title = {Quantitative Prediction of Interactions in Bipartite Networks Based on
   Traits, Abundances, and Phylogeny{*}},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Abstract = {Ecological interactions link species in networks. Loss of species from
   or introduction of new species into an existing network may have
   substantial effects for interaction patterns. Predicting changes in
   interaction frequency while allowing for rewiring of existing
   interactions-and hence estimating the consequences of community
   compositional changes-is thus a central challenge for network ecology.
   Interactions between species groups, such as pollinators and flowers or
   parasitoids and hosts, are moderated by matching morphological traits or
   sensory clues, most of which are unknown to us. If these traits are
   phylogenetically conserved, however, we can use phylogenetic distances
   to construct latent, surrogate traits and try to match those across
   groups, in addition to observed traits. Understanding how important
   traits and trait matching are, relative to abundances and chance, is
   crucial to estimating the fundamental predictability of network
   interactions. Here, we present a statistically sound approach
   ({''}tapnet{''}) to fitting abundances, traits, and phylogeny to
   observed network data to predict interaction frequencies. We thereby
   expand existing approaches to quantitative bipartite networks, which so
   far have failed to correctly represent the nonindependence of network
   interactions. Furthermore, we use simulations and cross validation on
   independent data to evaluate the predictive power of the fit. Our
   results show that tapnet is on a par with abundance-only, matching
   centrality, and machine learning approaches. This approach also allows
   us to evaluate how well current concepts of trait matching work. On the
   basis of our results, we expect that interactions in well-sampled
   networks can be well predicted if traits and abundances are the main
   driver of interaction frequency.},

Title = {Redescription mining for analyzing local limiting conditions: A case
   study on the biogeography of large mammals in China and southern Asia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Identifying and understanding limiting conditions is at the centre of
   ecology and biogeography. Traditionally, associations between climate
   and occurrences of organisms are inferred from observational data using
   regression analysis, correlation analysis or clustering. Those methods
   extract patterns and relationships that hold throughout a dataset. We
   present a computational methodology called redescription mining, that
   emphasizes local patterns and associations that hold strongly on subsets
   of the dataset, instead. We aim to showcase the potential of this
   methodology for ecological and biogeographical studies, and encourage
   researchers to try it. Redescription mining can be used to identify
   associations between different descriptive views of the same system. It
   produces an ensemble of local models, that provide different
   perspectives over the system. Each model (redescription) consists of two
   sets of limiting conditions, over two different views, that hold
   locally. Limiting conditions, as well as the corresponding subregions,
   are identified automatically using data analysis algorithms.
   We explain how this methodology applies to a biogeographic case study
   focused on China and southern Asia. We consider dental traits of the
   large herbivorous mammals that occur there and climatic conditions as
   two aspects of this ecological system, and look for associations between
   them.
   Redescription mining can offer more refined inferences on the potential
   relation between variables describing different aspects of a system than
   classical methods. Thus, it permits different questions to be posed of
   the data, and can usefully complement classical methods in ecology and
   biogeography to uncover novel biogeographic patterns.
   A python package for carrying out redescription mining analysis is
   publicly available.},

Title = {Offshore snapper and shark distributions are predicted by prey and area

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {682},
Pages = {169-189},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Seascape ecology has demonstrated that marine fishes are associated with
   multiscale habitat characteristics; however, most species distribution
   models focus on only a few predictors (e.g. depth, temperature), and
   this limits knowledge of essential fish habitat characteristics. Our
   objectives were to (1) determine habitat associations of offshore
   predatory marine fishes using a comprehensive suite of predictors,
   including area of nearby estuarine environments, (2) assess variable
   influence, and (3) model the spatial distribution of selected fishes in
   the families Carcharhinidae and Lutjanidae. We hypothesized that the
   concept of coastal outwelling would be evidenced by species associations
   with areas of nearby estuarine environments, and prey abundance would
   correlate with predator distributions. Species distribution models were
   developed for 2 snapper and 3 shark species in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico, USA. We used 34 multiscale predictors to evaluate how fish
   probability of presence or catch per unit effort (CPUE) were associated
   with oceanography, geography, substrate, area of nearby wetlands and
   estuaries, and prey abundance. Boosted regression trees, a
   machine-learning technique, modeled the most influential variables and
   predicted distributions. Model validation showed an overall accuracy of
   79-86\%, and CPUE models explained >40\% of model deviance.
   Oceanographic variables, particularly mixed layer depth, were most
   influential and most frequently selected. As hypothesized, predatory
   fish distributions were predicted by prey abundances, and shark
   distributions were predicted by area of nearby coastal wetlands and
   estuaries. Our findings suggest that spatial models can provide novel
   insights into prey associations and linkages of marine species with
   nearby wetlands and estuaries.},

Title = {Landscape epidemiology of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans: reconciling
   data limitations and conservation urgency},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Starting in 2010, rapid-fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra)
   population declines in northwestern Europe heralded the emergence of
   Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), a salamander-pathogenic
   chytrid fungus. Bsal poses an imminent threat to global salamander
   diversity owing to its wide host range, high pathogenicity, and
   long-term persistence in ecosystems. While there is a pressing need to
   develop further research and conservation actions, data limitations
   inherent to recent pathogen emergence obscure necessary insights into
   Bsal disease ecology. Here, we use a hierarchical modeling framework to
   describe Bsal landscape epidemiology of outbreak sites in light of these
   methodological challenges. Using model selection and machine learning,
   we find that Bsal presence is associated with humid and relatively cool,
   stable climates. Outbreaks are generally located in areas characterized
   by low landscape heterogeneity and low steepness of slope. We further
   find an association between Bsal presence and high trail density,
   suggesting that human-mediated spread may increase risk for spillover
   between populations. We then use distribution modeling to show that
   favorable conditions occur in lowlands influenced by the North Sea,
   where increased survey effort is needed to determine how Bsal impacts
   local newt populations, but also in hill- and mountain ranges in
   northeastern France and the lower half of Germany. Finally, connectivity
   analyses suggest that these hill- and mountain ranges may act as
   stepping stones for further spread southward. Our results provide
   initial insight into regional environmental conditions underlying Bsal
   epizootics, present updated invasibility predictions for northwestern
   Europe, and lead us to discuss a wide variety of potential survey and
   research actions needed to advance future conservation and mitigation
   efforts.},

Title = {Comparative performance of modelling approaches for predicting fish
   species richness in the Yangtze River Estuary},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fish species richness (FSR) has been widely used as an indicator of both
   ecological variation and fish biodiversity. On global and local scales,
   FSR has been declining due to human impact. Species distribution models,
   such as conventional regression techniques and machine learning methods,
   have played a critical role in predicting the distribution of FSR in
   estuarine systems. The Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is the largest
   estuarine ecosystem in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a muddy estuary
   providing many important ecosystem functioning services acting as
   spawning, feeding, and nursing grounds for a variety of valuable
   commercial species such as Coilia ectenes and Muraenesox cinereus.
   Despite this, the spatial distribution of FSR in the YRE has not been
   estimated. In this study, four modelling approaches (generalized linear
   model, generalized additive model, regression tree, and boosted
   regression tree) are applied to predict FSR in the YRE. Model
   performance was compared by evaluating the fit and predictive
   performance via deviation explained, root mean squared error, and
   cross-validation. Finally, the spatial distribution of FSR was estimated
   by the optimal model. It was shown that a regression tree approach
   outperformed the other methods. Additionally, regression tree modelling
   captured the overall distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE. The factors
   that appear to be contributing to the distribution pattern of FSR in the
   YRE included environmental conditions, fish migrations, and local
   physical characteristics (e.g. runoff and tide). The results from this
   study could provide guidance for the conservation planning and spatial
   management of the YRE. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Dealing with spatial autocorrelation when learning predictive clustering
   trees},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {22-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is the correlation among data values which is
   strictly due to the relative spatial proximity of the objects that the
   data refer to. Inappropriate treatment of data with spatial
   dependencies, where spatial autocorrelation is ignored, can obfuscate
   important insights. In this paper, we propose a data mining method that
   explicitly considers spatial autocorrelation in the values of the
   response (target) variable when learning predictive clustering models.
   The method is based on the concept of predictive clustering trees
   (PCTs), according to which hierarchies of clusters of similar data are
   identified and a predictive model is associated to each cluster. In
   particular, our approach is able to learn predictive models for both a
   continuous response (regression task) and a discrete response
   (classification task). We evaluate our approach on several real world
   problems of spatial regression and spatial classification. The
   consideration of the autocorrelation in the models improves predictions
   that are consistently clustered in space and that clusters try to
   preserve the spatial arrangement of the data, at the same time providing
   a multi-level insight into the spatial autocorrelation phenomenon. The
   evaluation of SCLUS in several ecological domains (e.g. predicting
   outcrossing rates within a conventional field due to the surrounding
   genetically modified fields, as well as predicting pollen dispersal
   rates from two lines of plants) confirms its capability of building
   spatial aware models which capture the spatial distribution of the
   target variable. In general, the maps obtained by using SCLUS do not
   require further post-smoothing of the results if we want to use them in
   practice. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Prioritizing coastal wetlands for marsh bird conservation in the US
   Great Lakes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {249},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Human activity surrounding the Laurentian Great Lakes basin has
   significantly degraded coastal wetland habitats, resulting in severe
   marsh bird population declines and reduced coastal resilience to
   changing environmental conditions. Given the need to conserve remaining
   coastal wetlands for wildlife and people, we developed a spatial
   prioritization to identify the most important U.S. Great Lakes coastal
   wetlands for 14 marsh bird species. We modeled occurrence and relative
   abundance of each species using boosted regression trees, a machine
   learning algorithm, to relate standardized monitoring data to ten
   remotely-sensed environmental covariates. We then used Zonation
   conservation planning software to rank every wetland cell based on its
   importance for the suite of marsh bird species. Evaluation of the
   drivers of marsh bird occurrence and abundance revealed that open water,
   herbaceous wetland, latitude, longitude, and impervious surface were the
   most important predictors across focal species. The high-priority
   wetlands for marsh birds (defined as grid cells ranked in the top 20\%)
   occurred along the shores of eastern Lake Ontario, western Lake Erie/St.
   Clair, Saginaw Bay, Green Bay, northern lakes Michigan and Huron, and
   western Lake Superior. Overall, less than half (42\%) of high priority
   coastal wetlands across the Great Lakes basin are currently under some
   level of protection, with Lake Ontario priority wetlands being the least
   protected (25\%). Our findings represent an opportunity to improve
   coastal wetland conservation in a region where wetland loss and
   degradation continue to threaten marsh bird populations and the
   integrity of one of the world's largest freshwater ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Context Resilience is a concept central to the field of ecology, but our
   understanding of resilience is not sufficient to predict when and where
   large changes in species composition might occur following disturbances,
   particularly under climate change. Objectives Our objective was to
   estimate how wind disturbance shapes landscape-level patterns of
   engineering resilience, defined as the recovery of total biomass and
   species composition after a windstorm, under climate change in central
   Wisconsin. Methods We used a spatially-explicit, forest simulation model
   (LANDIS-II) to simulate how windstorms and climate change affect forest
   succession and used boosted regression tree analysis to isolate the
   important drivers of resilience. Results At mid-century, biomass fully
   recovered to current conditions, but neither biomass nor species
   composition completely recovered at the end of the century. As expected,
   resilience was lower in the south, but by the end of the century,
   resilience was low throughout the landscape. Disturbance and species'
   characteristics (e.g., the amount of area disturbed and the number of
   species) explained half of the variation in resilience, while
   temperature and soil moisture comprised only 17\% collectively.
   Conclusions Our results illustrate substantial spatial patterns of
   resilience at landscape scales, while documenting the potential for
   overall declines in resilience through time. Species diversity and
   windstorm size were far more important than temperature and soil
   moisture in driving long term trends in resilience. Finally, our
   research highlights the utility of using machine learning (e.g., boosted
   regression trees) to discern the underlying mechanisms of
   landscape-scale processes when using complex spatially-interactive and
   non-deterministic simulation models.},

Title = {Integrative species delimitation reveals cryptic diversity in the

Abstract = {Although species delimitation can be highly contentious, the development
   of reliable methods to accurately ascertain species boundaries is an
   imperative step in cataloguing and describing Earth's quickly
   disappearing biodiversity. Spider species delimitation remains largely
   based on morphological characters; however, many mygalomorph spider
   populations are morphologically indistinguishable from each other yet
   have considerable molecular divergence. The focus of our study,
   theAntrodiaetus unicolorspecies complex containing two sympatric
   species, exhibits this pattern of relative morphological stasis with
   considerable genetic divergence across its distribution. A past study
   using two molecular markers,COIand 28S, revealed thatA. unicoloris
   paraphyletic with respect toA. microunicolor. To better investigate
   species boundaries in the complex, we implement the cohesion species
   concept and use multiple lines of evidence for testing genetic
   exchangeability and ecological interchangeability. Our integrative
   approach includes extensively sampling homologous loci across the genome
   using a RADseq approach (3RAD), assessing population structure across
   their geographic range using multiple genetic clustering analyses that
   includestructure, principal components analysis and a recently developed
   unsupervised machine learning approach (Variational Autoencoder). We
   evaluate ecological similarity by using large-scale ecological data for
   niche-based distribution modelling. Based on our analyses, we conclude
   that this complex has at least one additional species as well as confirm
   species delimitations based on previous less comprehensive approaches.
   Our study demonstrates the efficacy of genomic-scale data for
   recognizing cryptic species, suggesting that species delimitation with
   one data type, whether one mitochondrial gene or morphology, may
   underestimate true species diversity in morphologically homogenous taxa
   with low vagility.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal patterns of Permit (Trachinotus falcatus) habitat
   residency in the Florida Keys, USA},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES},

Volume = {106},

Abstract = {Permit (Trachinotus falcatus) occupy a variety of coastal marine
   habitats and support valuable recreational fisheries in their home
   region of the Caribbean Sea. As an aggregate spawning species, Permit
   require careful management in locations such as the Florida Keys where
   they experience substantial fishing pressure. We used acoustic telemetry
   to examine Permit residency patterns over 4 years amongst 12
   high-residency sites that are likely important spawning (natural or
   artificial reefs) or foraging (seagrass flats) habitats. Residency was
   highest in artificial reefs, supporting previous research that suggests
   Permit have high fidelity to these habitats compared to seagrass flats
   and natural reefs on the Florida Reef Tract, which are highly connected.
   Residency peaked in the spring and summer months in most sites, with a
   marked decline in the late fall, suggesting potential undetected
   movement outside the region during that period. Permit exhibited high
   residency at an important spawning site in March, indicating that this
   spawning aggregation is vulnerable to fishing pressure with current
   regulations, which protect Permit from April through July. Seagrass
   flats in close proximity (<10 km) to spawning locations are likely of
   high importance to Permit as a food source during the extensive spawning
   season. Permit residency was generally consistent amongst water
   temperatures, although residency patterns varied with temperature
   amongst sites. Residency at natural reef spawning sites increased
   leading up to the full moon, which is a potential spawning cue for this
   species. These findings build on a body of recent research on Florida
   Keys Permit, providing residency information over space and time that
   may help to further guide the development of marine protected areas and
   fisheries regulations.},

Title = {Effects of climate change on the ecological niche of common hornbeam
   (Carpinus betulus L.)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is an urgent need to conduct scientific research in order to
   comprehend the impact of climate change on the geographical distribution
   of species that constitute an ecological niche. To meet this need, the
   current and future distribution areas of a species can be predicted by
   applying machine learning techniques. This study aims to model the
   current and future geographical distribution of common hornbeam under
   different climate scenarios. Furthermore, we focus on the differences
   between the predicted current and future potential distribution areas of
   the species in terms of area and location by means of change analysis.
   15 bioclimatic variables obtained for presence data from sample points
   representing the natural distribution area of common hornbeam were
   reduced to six variables to prevent high correlation and
   multi-collinearity. Next, the CNRM-ESM-1 climate change model was used
   to determine how the distribution areas of the species will be affected
   by climate change and the potential distribution areas of the species
   under the SSP2 4.5 and SSP5 8.5 scenarios in the periods 2041-2060 and
   2081-2100 were modelled by MaxEnt 3.4.4 software. The change analysis
   comparing the current and future potential distribution areas suggested
   that common hornbeam would be affected by climate change, expanding its
   range in the north. The findings can be used effectively to address
   biodiversity conversation planning and management as a whole and develop
   new strategies. In this way, future risks can be diminished.},

Title = {Generalizing the use of geographical weights in biodiversity modelling},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1314-1323},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {AimDetermining how ecological processes vary across space is a major
   focus in ecology. Current methods that investigate such effects remain
   constrained by important limiting assumptions. Here we provide an
   extension to geographically weighted regression in which local
   regression and spatial weighting are used in combination. This method
   can be used to investigate non-stationarity and spatial-scale effects
   using any regression technique that can accommodate uneven weighting of
   observations, including machine learning.
   InnovationWe extend the use of spatial weights to generalized linear
   models and boosted regression trees by using simulated data for which
   the results are known, and compare these local approaches with existing
   alternatives such as geographically weighted regression (GWR). The
   spatial weighting procedure (1) explained up to 80\% deviance in
   simulated species richness, (2) optimized the normal distribution of
   model residuals when applied to generalized linear models versus GWR,
   and (3) detected nonlinear relationships and interactions between
   response variables and their predictors when applied to boosted
   regression trees. Predictor ranking changed with spatial scale,
   highlighting the scales at which different species-environment
   relationships need to be considered.
   Main conclusionsGWR is useful for investigating spatially varying
   species-environment relationships. However, the use of local weights
   implemented in alternative modelling techniques can help detect
   nonlinear relationships and high-order interactions that were previously
   unassessed. Therefore, this method not only informs us how location and
   scale influence our perception of patterns and processes, it also offers
   a way to deal with different ecological interpretations that can emerge
   as different areas of spatial influence are considered during model
   fitting.},

Title = {Patch and landscape responses of bird abundance to fragmentation in

Journal = {AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation in agroecosystems is linked to declines of avian
   species worldwide. Agriculture has greatly reduced native forest cover
   in east-central Argentina. Assessing the influence of fragmentation on
   forest bird populations is vital to inform reliable conservation and
   management strategies for the Espinal region of Argentina. We determined
   the relationships of vegetation structure within native forest patches,
   size and shape of these patches (patch scale), composition and spatial
   configuration (at landscape scale) to relative abundance of 17 forest
   bird species during austral fall-winter and spring-summer seasons. Birds
   were sampled from 2007-2009 in 45 forest patches within three landscape
   mosaics (30 x 30 km) representing a gradient of native forest
   fragmentation in east-central Argentina. We used an
   information-theoretic approach and approximated model inference to
   examine the effect of predictor environmental variables at two spatial
   scales on patterns of forest bird abundance. Density of trees within
   forest patches was the main predictor of bird abundance at the patch
   scale. Amount of forest and spatial configuration were also important.
   The abundance of several bird species was greater in patches with high
   density of trees and landscapes characterized by more forest cover and
   larger patches in close proximity. We found two main avian response
   patterns to forest fragmentation and patch characteristics. This
   information contributes reliable knowledge for the design of
   conservation measures of agricultural landscapes in the Espinal region
   of Argentina.},

Abstract = {Urbanization can have profound impacts on the distributional ecology of
   wildlife and livestock, with implications for biodiversity conservation,
   ecosystem services and human health. A wealth of studies have assessed
   biotic responses to urbanization in North America and Europe, but there
   is little empirical evidence that directly links human activities to
   urban biodiversity in the tropics. Results from a large-scale field
   study conducted in Nairobi, Kenya, are used to explore the impact of
   human activities on the biodiversity of wildlife and livestock with
   which humans co-exist across the city. The structure of sympatric
   wildlife, livestock and human populations are characterized using
   unsupervised machine learning, and statistical modelling is used to
   relate compositional variation in these communities to socio-ecological
   drivers occurring across the city. By characterizing landscape-scale
   drivers acting on these interfaces, we demonstrate that socioeconomics,
   elevation and subsequent changes in habitat have measurable impacts upon
   the diversity, density and species assemblage of wildlife, livestock and
   humans. Restructuring of wildlife and livestock assemblages (both in
   terms of species diversity and composition) has important implications
   for the emergence of novel diseases at urban interfaces, and we
   therefore use our results to generate a set of testable hypotheses that
   explore the influence of urban change on microbial communities. These
   results provide novel insight into the impact of urbanization on
   biodiversity in the tropics. An understanding of associations between
   urban processes and the structure of human and animal populations is
   required to link urban development to conservation efforts and risks
   posed by disease emergence to human health, ultimately informing
   sustainable urban development policy.},

Title = {Key management rules for agricultural alpine newt breeding ponds based
   on habitat suitability models},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris, is very sensitive to habitat
   destruction and alteration which has led to declining populations across
   Europe. As this species is protected through the Bern Convention, it is
   essential to have a comprehensive understanding of its habitat
   requirements to ensure proper conservation measures. We trained,
   validated and optimized classification tree models based on data on
   local aquatic habitat conditions from 125 farmland ponds scattered over
   Belgium and Luxembourg where the alpine newt commonly occurs. To obtain
   user-friendly and representative models, data was preprocessed and
   stratified after which different degrees of pruning were applied for
   model optimization. In order to check the model's applicability for
   management, we predicted alpine newt occurrence with an independent
   dataset. The most robust and reliable model revealed that fish absence
   was the major driving factor followed by the thickness of the sludge
   layer. We found that fish presence established alpine newt absence and
   that fishless ponds with a sludge layer of 15 cm or more were predicted
   to host no alpine newts. The latter provides quantitative information
   for decision makers. Moreover, our results indicated that the amount of
   sludge could be associated with eutrophication and erosion. Regarding
   management practices, it is advised to assure the absence of fish and
   reduce sludge accumulation in ponds designated for the conservation of
   alpine newts, for example by designing temporary ponds not fed through
   fish-containing surface waters. Furthermore, we recommend to install
   buffer strips around a pond to reduce nutrient and soil run-off from the
   terrestrial environment. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Loss of endemic fish species drives impacts on functional richness,
   redundancy and vulnerability in freshwater ecoregions of Sundaland},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {234},
Pages = {72-81},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fishes are a speciose and ecologically important group within severely
   threatened or impacted freshwater habitats of Sundaland, whose
   contributions to ecosystem functioning can be inferred from their
   functional diversity. However, there is limited understanding of the
   potential impacts of anthropogenic species loss on ichthyofaunal
   functional diversity in the region. We therefore aimed to characterise
   the functional diversity of fishes across freshwater ecoregions in
   Sundaland, and predict potential impacts of anthropogenic species losses
   on functional diversity, in order to identify priority ecoregions for
   freshwater fish conservation. To this end, data comprising nine
   functional traits of 893 Sundaic freshwater fish species were compiled
   and analysed to compute measures of functional richness, functional
   redundancy and functional vulnerability. We then modelled the loss of
   extinction-prone species (identified using a trait-based conditional
   inference forest approach) within each ecoregion, and quantified the
   resulting impacts on functional diversity. Both functional richness and
   functional redundancy scale positively with species richness across
   ecoregions, but functional vulnerability is widespread. Functional
   entities comprising moderate- to large-sized omnivores or higher
   carnivores are particularly vulnerable, and the same is true for fishes
   with superiorly-oriented and toothed mouthparts. Removal of susceptible
   endemic species in each ecoregion resulted in the erosion of functional
   redundancy and exacerbation of functional vulnerability, but functional
   richness was relatively less impacted. Overall, our findings suggest a
   trajectory of accelerating impacts on functional diversity (and by
   extension, ecosystem function) if species losses continue unabated. From
   these results, we identify the Malay Peninsula Eastern Slope ecoregion
   as a potential conservation priority.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Ecosystem ecologists are being challenged to address the increasingly
   complex problems that comprise Big Science. These problems include
   multiple levels of biological organization that cross multiple
   interacting temporal and spatial scales, from individual plants,
   animals, and microbes to landscapes, continents, and the globe. As
   technology improves, the availability of data, derived data products,
   and information to address these complex problems are increasing at
   finer and coarser scales of resolution, and legacy, dark data are
   brought to light. Data analytics are improving as big data increase in
   importance in other fields that are improving access to these data. New
   data sources (crowdsourcing, social media) and ease of communication and
   collaboration among ecosystem ecologists and other disciplines are
   increasingly possible via the internet. It is increasingly important
   that ecosystem ecologists be able to communicate their findings, and to
   translate their concepts and findings into concrete bits of information
   that a general public can understand. Traditional approaches that
   portray ecosystem sciences as a dichotomy between empirical research and
   theoretical research will keep the field from fully contributing to the
   complexity of global change questions, and will keep ecosystem
   ecologists from taking full advantage of the data and technology
   available. Building on previous research, we describe a more
   forward-looking, integrated empirical-theoretical modeling approach that
   is iterative with learning to take advantage of the elements of Big
   Science. We suggest that training ecosystem ecologists in this
   integrated approach will be critical to addressing complex Earth system
   science questions, now and in the future.},

Volume = {84},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The composition, function, and assembly mechanism of the bacterial
   community are the focus of microbial ecology. Unsupervised machine
   learning may be a better way to understand the characteristics of
   bacterial metacommunities compared to the empirical habitat types. In
   this study, the composition, potential function, and assembly mechanism
   of the bacterial community in the arid river were analysed. The
   Dirichlet multinomial mixture method recognised four ecotypes across the
   three habitats (biofilm, water, and sediment). The bacterial communities
   in water are more sensitive to human activities. Bacterial diversity and
   richness in water decreased as the intensity of human activities
   increased from the region of water II to water I. Significant
   differences in the composition and potential function profile of
   bacterial communities between water ecotypes were also observed, such as
   higher relative abundance in the taxonomic composition of Firmicutes and
   potential function of plastic degradation in water I than those in water
   II. Habitat filtering may play a more critical role in the assembly of
   bacterial communities in the river biofilm, while stochastic processes
   dominate the assembly process of bacterial communities in water and
   sediment. In water I, salinity and mean annual precipitation were the
   main drivers shaping the biogeography of taxonomic structure, while mean
   annual temperature, total organic carbon, and ammonium nitrogen were the
   main environmental factors influencing the taxonomic structure in water
   II. These results would provide conceptual frameworks about choosing
   habitat types or ecotypes for the research of microbial communities
   among different niches in the aquatic environment.},

Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and
   predict species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly
   constructed by inferring species' occurrence-environment relationships
   using statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods
   that can be used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive
   models, tree-based models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of
   ways that such models can be implemented, permits substantial
   flexibility in SDM complexity. Building models with an appropriate
   amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust
   inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the inferred
   occurrence-environment relationships and the number of parameters used
   to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional
   complexity is informative or superfluous. By building `under fit'
   models, having insufficient flexibility to describe observed
   occurrence-environment relationships, we risk misunderstanding the
   factors shaping species distributions. By building `over fit' models,
   with excessive flexibility, we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to
   noise or building opaque models. However, model selection can be
   challenging, especially when comparing models constructed under
   different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more pragmatic
   approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their models
   based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding
   of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We
   discuss guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and
   consequently how complexity affects decisions made during model
   building. Although some generalities are possible, our discussion
   reflects differences in opinions that favor simpler versus more complex
   models. We conclude that combining insights from both simple and complex
   SDM building approaches best advances our knowledge of current and
   future species ranges.},

Abstract = {The definition of colour polymorphism is intuitive: genetic variants
   express discretely coloured phenotypes. This classification is, however,
   elusive as humans form subjective categories or ignore differences that
   cannot be seen by human eyes. We demonstrate an example of a `cryptic
   morph' in a polymorphic wood tiger moth (Arctia plantaginis), a
   phenomenon that may be common among well-studied species. We used
   pedigree data from nearly 20,000 individuals to infer the inheritance of
   hindwing colouration. The evidence supports a single Mendelian locus
   with two alleles in males: WW and Wy produce the white and yy the yellow
   hindwing colour. The inheritance could not be resolved in females as
   their hindwing colour varies continuously with no clear link with male
   genotypes. Next, we investigated if the male genotype can be predicted
   from their phenotype by machine learning algorithms and by human
   observers. Linear discriminant analysis grouped male genotypes with 97\%
   accuracy, whereas humans could only group the yy genotype. Using vision
   modelling, we also tested whether the genotypes have differential
   discriminability to humans, moth conspecifics and their bird predators.
   The human perception was poor separating the genotypes, but avian and
   moth vision models with ultraviolet sensitivity could separate white WW
   and Wy males. We emphasize the importance of objective methodology when
   studying colour polymorphism. Our findings indicate that by-eye
   categorization methods may be problematic, because humans fail to see
   differences that can be visible for relevant receivers. Ultimately,
   receivers equipped with different perception than ours may impose
   selection to morphs hidden from human sight.},

Title = {Automated synthesis of biodiversity knowledge requires better tools and
   standardised research output},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As the impact of anthropogenic activity on the environment has grown,
   research into biodiversity change and associated threats has also
   accelerated. Synthesising this vast literature is important for
   understanding the drivers of biodiversity change and identifying those
   actions that will mitigate further ecological losses. However, keeping
   pace with an ever-increasing publication rate presents a substantial
   challenge to efficient syntheses, an issue which could be partly
   addressed by increasing levels of automation in the synthesis pipeline.
   Here, we evaluate the potential for automated tools to extract
   ecologically important information from the abstracts of articles
   compiled in the Living Planet Database. Specifically, we focused on
   extracting key information on taxonomy (studied species names),
   geographic location and estimated population trend, assessing the
   accuracy of automated versus manual information extraction, the
   potential for automated tools to introduce biases into syntheses, and
   evaluating if synthesising abstracts was enough to capture the key
   information from the full article. Taxonomic and geographic extraction
   tools performed reasonably well, although information on studied species
   was sometimes limited in the abstract (compared to the main text)
   preventing fast extraction. In contrast, extraction of trends was less
   successful, highlighting the challenges involved in automating
   information extraction from abstracts, such as deficiencies in the
   algorithms, linguistic complexity associated with ecological findings,
   and limited information when compared to the main text. In light of
   these results, we cautiously advocate for a wider use of automated
   taxonomic and geographic parsing tools for ecological synthesis.
   Additionally, to further the use of automated synthesis within ecology,
   we recommend a dual approach: development of improved computational
   tools to reduce biases; and enhanced protocols for abstracts (and
   associated metadata) to ensure key information is included in a format
   that facilitates machine-readability.},

Abstract = {Coarse-resolution thematic maps derived from remotely sensed data and
   implemented in GIS play an important role in coastal and marine
   conservation, research and management. Here, we describe an approach for
   fine-resolution mapping of land-cover types using aerial photography and
   ancillary GIs and ground data in a large (100 x 35 km) subtropical
   estuarine system (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). We have developed
   and implemented a classification scheme representing 24 coastal
   (subtidal, intertidal. mangrove, supratidal and terrestrial) cover types
   relevant to the ecology of estuarine animals, nekton and shorebirds. The
   accuracy of classifications of the intertidal and subtidal cover types,
   as indicated by the agreement between the mapped (predicted) and
   reference (ground) data, was 77-88\%, depending on the zone and level of
   generalization required. The variability and spatial distribution of
   habitat mosaics (landscape types) across the mapped environment were
   assessed using K-means clustering and validated with Classification and
   Regression Tree models. Seven broad landscape types could be
   distinguished and ways of incorporating the information on landscape
   composition into site-specific conservation and field research are
   discussed. This research illustrates the importance and potential
   applications of fine-resolution mapping for conservation and management
   of estuarine habitats and their terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. (c)

Title = {Predicting abundance of 80 tree species following climate change in the

Abstract = {Projected climate warming will potentially have profound effects on the
   earth's biota, including a large redistribution of tree species. We
   developed models to evaluate potential shifts for 80 individual tree
   species in the eastern United States. First, environmental factors
   associated with current ranges of tree species were assessed using
   geographic information systems (GIS) in conjunction with regression tree
   analysis (RTA). The method was then extended to better understand the
   potential of species to survive and/or migrate under a changed climate.
   We collected, summarized, and analyzed data for climate, soils, land
   use, elevation, and species assemblages for >2100 counties east of the
   100th meridian. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data for >100000
   forested plots in the East provided the tree species range and abundance
   information for the trees. RTA was used to devise prediction rules from
   current species-environment relationships, which were then used to
   replicate the current distribution as well as predict the future
   potential distributions under two scenarios of climate change with
   twofold increases in the level of atmospheric CO2. Validation measures
   prove the utility of the RTA modeling approach for mapping current tree
   importance values across large areas, leading to increased confidence in
   the predictions of potential future species distributions.
   With our analysis of potential effects, we show that roughly 30 species
   could expand their range and/or weighted importance at least 10\%, while
   an additional 30 species could decrease by at least 10\%, following
   equilibrium after a changed climate. Depending on the global change
   scenario used, 4-9 species would potentially move out of the United
   States to the north. Nearly half of the species assessed (36 out of 80)
   showed the potential for the ecological optima to shift at least 100 km
   to the north, including seven that could move >250 km. Given these
   potential future distributions, actual species redistributions will be
   controlled by migration rates possible through fragmented landscapes.},

Abstract = {Predation is an interaction during which an organism kills and feeds on
   another organism. Past and current interest in studying predation in
   terrestrial habitats has yielded a number of methods to assess
   invertebrate predation events in terrestrial ecosystems. We provide a
   decision tree to select appropriate methods for individual studies. For
   each method, we then present a short introduction, key examples for
   applications, advantages and disadvantages, and an outlook to future
   refinements. Video and, to a lesser extent, live observations are
   recommended in studies that address behavioral aspects of predator-prey
   interactions or focus on per capita predation rates. Cage studies are
   only appropriate for small predator species, but often suffer from a
   bias via cage effects. The use of prey baits or analyses of prey remains
   are cheaper than other methods and have the potential to provide per
   capita predation estimates. These advantages often come at the cost of
   low taxonomic specificity. Molecular methods provide reliable estimates
   at a fine level of taxonomic resolution and are free of observer bias
   for predator species of any size. However, the current PCR-based methods
   lack the ability to estimate predation rates for individual predators
   and are more expensive than other methods. Molecular and stable isotope
   analyses are best suited to address systems that include a range of
   predator and prey species. Our review of methods strongly suggests that
   while in many cases individual methods are sufficient to study specific
   questions, combinations of methods hold a high potential to provide more
   holistic insights into predation events. This review presents an
   overview of methods to researchers that are new to the field or to
   particular aspects of predation ecology and provides recommendations
   toward the subset of suitable methods to identify the prey of
   invertebrate predators in terrestrial field research.},

Abstract = {The introduction of animal-borne, multisensor tags has opened up many
   opportunities for ecological research, making previously inaccessible
   species and behaviors observable. The advancement of tag technology and
   the increasingly widespread use of bio-logging tags are leading to large
   volumes of sometimes extremely detailed data. With the increasing
   quantity and duration of tag deployments, a set of tools needs to be
   developed to aid in facilitating and standardizing the analysis of
   movement sensor data. Here, we developed an observation- based decision
   tree method to detect feeding events in data from multisensor movement
   tags attached to fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). Fin whales exhibit
   an energetically costly and kinematically complex foraging behavior
   called lunge feeding, an intermittent ram filtration mechanism. Using
   this automated system, we identified feeding lunges in 19 fin whales
   tagged with multisensor tags, during a total of over 100 h of
   continuously sampled data. Using movement sensor and hydrophone data,
   the automated lunge detector correctly identified an average of 92.8\%
   of all lunges, with a false-positive rate of 9.5\%. The strong
   performance of our automated feeding detector demonstrates an effective,
   straightforward method of activity identification in animal-borne
   movement tag data. Our method employs a detection algorithm that
   utilizes a hierarchy of simple thresholds based on knowledge of observed
   features of feeding behavior, a technique that is readily modifiable to
   fit a variety of species and behaviors. Using automated methods to
   detect behavioral events in tag records will significantly decrease data
   analysis time and aid in standardizing analysis methods, crucial
   objectives with the rapidly increasing quantity and variety of on-animal
   tag data. Furthermore, our results have implications for next-generation
   tag design, especially long-term tags that can be outfitted with
   on-board processing algorithms that automatically detect kinematic
   events and transmit ethograms via acoustic or satellite telemetry.},

Title = {Niche evolution in Australian terrestrial mammals? Clarifying

Abstract = {Interactive forces between competition and habitat filtering drive many
   biogeographic patterns over evolutionary time scales. However, the
   responsiveness of assemblages to these two forces is highly influenced
   by spatial scale, forming complex patterns of niche separation. We
   explored these spatial dependencies by quantifying the influence of
   phylogeny and functional traits in shaping present day native
   terrestrial mammal assemblages at multiple scales, principally by
   identifying the spatial scales at which niche evolution operates. We
   modelled the distribution of 53 native terrestrial mammal species across
   New South Wales, Australia. Using predicted distributions, we estimated
   the range overlap between each pair of species at increasing grain sizes
   (similar to 0.8, 5.1, 20, 81, 506, 2,025, 8,100 km(2)). We employed a
   decision tree to identify how interactions among functional traits and
   phylogenetic relatedness translated to levels of sympatry at increasing
   spatial scales. We found that Australian terrestrial mammals displayed
   phylogenetic over-dispersion that was inversely related to spatial
   scale, suggesting that ecological processes were more influential than
   biogeographic sympatry patterns in defining assemblages of species.
   While the contribution of phylogenetic relatedness to patterns of
   co-occurrence decreased as spatial scale increased, the reverse was true
   for habitat preferences. At the same time, functional traits also
   operated at different scales, as dietary preferences dominated at local
   spatial scales (< 10 km(2)) while body mass has a stronger effect at
   larger spatial scales. Our findings show that ecological and
   evolutionary processes operate at different scales and that Australian
   terrestrial mammals diverged slower along their micro-scale niche
   compared to their macro-scale niche. By combining phylogenetic and niche
   methods through the modelling of species distributions, we assessed
   whether specific traits were related to a particular niche. More
   importantly, conducting multi-scale spatial analysis avoids categorical
   assignment of traits-to-niches, providing a clearer relationship between
   traits and a species ecological niche and a more precise scaling for the
   axes of niche evolution.},

Title = {Where do functional traits come from? The role of theory and models},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1385-1396},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. The use of traits is growing in ecology and biodiversity informatics,
   with initiatives to collate trait data and integrate it into
   biodiversity databases. A need to develop better predictive capacity for
   how species respond to environmental change has in part motivated this
   focus. Functional traits are of most interest-those with a defined link
   to individual survival, development, growth and reproduction.
   2. Non-trivial challenges arise immediately in deciding which functional
   traits to prioritise and how to characterise them. Here we discuss the
   advantages of a theoretical perspective for defining functional traits
   in the context of dynamical systems models of energy and mass exchange
   that link organisms to their environments. We argue that the theoretical
   frameworks upon which such models are built (biophysical ecology,
   metabolic theory) provide clear criteria to decide upon functional trait
   definitions, measurement requirements and associated metadata, via their
   mathematical connection to model parameters and state variables, and
   thus to system performance (survival, development, growth and
   reproduction).
   3. We distinguish `descriptive' traits from `functional' traits by
   dividing the latter into four classes-parameter, model, threshold and
   estimation-according to whether they are model parameters, define model
   structure, are threshold state variables or can be used to estimate
   model parameters.
   4. We develop a decision tree for this classification and illustrate it
   in the context of mammalian heat exchange but emphasise the scheme's
   generality to any kind of organism.
   5. We show how a theoretical perspective may change how we prioritise
   traits for collection and databasing in ways that are not necessarily
   more difficult to achieve, especially with new technologies, and provide
   clear guidance for requisite metadata. The use of theoretically driven
   criteria for prioritising the collection of functional trait data will
   maximise the generality, quality and consistency of trait databases for
   comparative analyses. Such databases will simultaneously facilitate the
   development of integrated predictive modelling frameworks across
   multiple organisational scales from individuals to ecosystems.},

Title = {Diverging distribution of seedlings and mature trees reflects recent
   climate change in British Columbia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {384},

Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {The composition and health of forests across western North America have
   shown signs of change over the last half-century associated with altered
   climate conditions. Most models developed to predict responses to
   variation in climate assume that the ecological distribution of adult
   trees provides a sound basis for projecting potential shifts in a
   species' range. Under a dynamic climate, however, recently established
   seedlings may more closely reflect changes in climate conditions. This
   study combined the simple, widely tested physiological model 3-PG with
   an empirical regeneration dataset, composed of 21,097 plots, to assess
   regional scale changes in tree species distributions across British
   Columbia, Canada. We geographically registered all plot locations to
   correspond with topographically-adjusted 1 km monthly climatic data for
   the period 2000-2009. By comparing the distribution of seedlings to that
   of mature trees present in an earlier period (1950-1975), we could
   assess where alterations in the environment have occurred, and the
   extent to which changes may make a species vulnerable to replacement in
   some places or likely to regenerate and migrate elsewhere. Decision tree
   models were developed to assess the relative importance of suboptimal
   temperatures, frost, soil water deficits and evaporative demand on the
   growth and distribution of four widely distributed species: Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pious contorta), western larch
   (Larix occidentalis), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Tree
   responses varied by species, with areas suitable for lodgepole pine
   experiencing the largest relative increase in summer drought and areas
   dominated by western larch experiencing the least. Those areas modelled
   as suitable for species range expansions occurred 79\% (SD = 16\%) of
   the time in places where seedlings of a designated species were
   predicted in 2000-2009 using the regeneration dataset. We conclude that
   employing seedling surveys in concert with tree surveys provide valuable
   ecological insights when predicting species responses to climate shifts.},

Title = {The Need to Rationalize and Prioritize Threatening Processes Used to
   Determine Threat Status in the IUCN Red List},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1568-1576},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Thorough evaluation has made the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN) Red List the most widely used and accepted authority on
   the conservation status of biodiversity. Although the system used to
   determine risk of extinction is rigorously and objectively applied, the
   list of threatening processes affecting a species is far more
   subjectively determined and has not had adequate review. I reviewed the
   threats listed in the IUCN Red List for randomly selected groups within
   the three most threatened orders of mammals: Artiodactyla, Carnivora,
   and Primates. These groups are taxonomically related and often
   ecologically similar, so I expected they would suffer relatively similar
   threats. Hominoid primates and all other terrestrial fauna faced similar
   threats, except for bovine artiodactyls and large, predatory carnivores,
   which faced significantly different threats. Although the status of
   bovines and hominoids and the number of threats affecting them were
   correlated, this was not the case for large carnivores. Most notable,
   however, was the great variation in the threats affecting individual
   members of each group. For example, the endangered European bison (Bison
   bonasus) has no threatening processes listed for it, and the lion
   (Panthera leo) is the only large predator listed as threatened with
   extinction by civil war. Some threatening processes appear spurious for
   the conservation of the species, whereas other seemingly important
   factors are not recorded as threats. The subjective nature of listing
   threatening processes, via expert opinion, results in substantial biases
   that may be allayed by independent peer review, use of technical
   manuals, consensus among multiple assessors, incorporation of
   probability modeling via decision-tree analysis, and adequate
   coordination among evaluators. The primary focus should be on
   species-level threats rather than population-level threats because the
   IUCN Red List is a global assessment and smaller-scale threats are more
   appropriate for national status assessments. Until conservationists
   agree on the threats affecting species and their relative importance,
   conservation action and success will be hampered by scattering scarce
   resources too widely and often by implementing conflicting strategies.},

Title = {Beyond dispersal versus philopatry? Alternative behavioural tactics of

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although inter-individual heterogeneity in many aspects of dispersal
   behaviour is widely reported, this key life-history trait is
   predominantly modelled as a dichotomous state of philopatry versus
   dispersal. The increasing body of evidence for dispersal syndromes (i.e.
   a suite of correlated morphological, behavioural and life-history traits
   associated with dispersal) implies substantial but, to date,
   undocumented individual heterogeneity in behavioural tactics during
   dispersal. Using a large sample (n = 154) of GPS monitored juvenile roe
   deer Capreolus capreolus, we evaluated among-individual behavioural
   heterogeneity in dispersal tactics, and the individual and environmental
   drivers of these alternative tactics. We developed a sequential
   three-stage decision tree based on space use stability, exploration
   events and the directionality of movement. We identified six discrete
   alternative behavioural tactics during the dispersal period which were
   characterised by different timing, amplitude and duration in movement:
   slightly less than half of the deer were sedentary, either `strictly
   philopatric' or `explorers', which subsequently settled on their natal
   range; around 40\% dispersed ('classic dispersal'), of which, one in six
   subsequently aborted, moving back to their natal range ('aborted
   dispersal'); finally, around 15\% expressed either a `progressive
   dispersal' tactic, gradually moving away from their natal area to settle
   elsewhere, or a `multi-range' tactic. The propensity to express an
   alternative dispersal tactic was strongly influenced by an individual's
   local environment. In particular, when landscape heterogeneity, resource
   quality and human-related disturbance in the natal range were low,
   individuals were 1) more likely to adopt the alternative tactics of
   either progressive dispersal or multi-ranging, but 2) also more likely
   to abort their dispersal attempt. Our work indicates that natal
   dispersal is likely not a single uniform behaviour, but that individuals
   may adopt a variety of alternative movement tactics which are likely
   governed by different selection pressures, with potentially important
   impacts for population dynamics and functioning.},

Title = {Putting a cart before the search: Successful habitat prediction for a

Abstract = {The realms of rare species conservation and metapopulation biology
   theory are often interrelated, and hence share several basic challenges.
   Two of the most important are the critical and frequently difficult
   tasks of distinguishing a priori between habitat and nonhabitat, and
   then delimiting suitable habitat patches in a study area. We combined
   classification tree analysis, a subset of classification and regression
   tree (CART) modeling, with digital data layers of environmental
   variables in a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable
   habitat and potential new population occurrences for turkeybeard
   (Xerophyllum asphodeloides), a rare liliaceous understory herb
   associated with southern Appalachian pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests,
   in northwestern Virginia. Sample values from eight environmental data
   layers and population survey data were used in the modeling process to
   produce a cross-validated classification tree that predicted suitable
   habitat in the study area. Elevation, slope, forest type, and fire
   frequency were the four main explanatory variables in the model.
   Approximately 4\% of the study area was classified into five suitable
   habitat classes, with a misclassification error rate of 4.74\%. The
   final 13-leaf tree correctly classified 74\% of the known presence areas
   and 90\% of the known absence areas, and ground-truthing surveys
   resulted in the discovery of eight new occupied habitat patches. Results
   of this study are important for conservation and management of X.
   asphodeloides, as well as for the applicability of the habitat modeling
   techniques to enhancing the study of metapopulations and disturbance
   regimes in Appalachian forests. In addition, they confirm the potential
   and value of CART and GIS-based modeling approaches to species
   distribution problems. Our model was successful at defining suitable
   habitat and discovering new populations of a rare species at the
   landscape scale. Similar application to other rare species could prove
   very useful for addressing these and other ecological and conservation
   issues, such as planning transplantation or reintroduction experiments,
   identifying metapopulation fragmentation thresholds, and formulating
   conservation strategies.},

Title = {The role of bioclimatic features, landscape configuration and historical
   land use in the invasion of an Asian tree in subtropical Argentina},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {11, SI},
Pages = {2167-2185},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Knowing which factors determine the spread of plant invaders is a
   relevant issue in global ecology. Cultural landscapes both influence and
   are affected by exotic species. Although bioclimatic boundaries, seed
   sources and landscape configuration all control the invasion process,
   they have been mostly studied separately and independently from their
   distant drivers.
   We followed a multiscale approach to describe the invasion dynamics of
   the Asian tree (Ligustrum lucidum) in subtropical NW Argentina cultural
   landscapes by: (1) identifying the potential bioclimatic area of
   invasion, (2) mapping the currently invaded area in peri-urban focal
   sectors, and (3) quantitatively describing the landscape-scale patterns
   of invasion in relation to environmental and cultural variables.
   Niche models were used to map potential invasion area, remote sensing,
   GIS and field surveys to map patterns of invasion and their association
   to landscape and environmental variables.
   Climate suitability to L. lucidum extends over important ranges of the
   studied area, but currently invaded areas are mostly restricted to
   clusters around the main cities. The historical and demographic features
   of cities (e.g., date foundation, population) are important in
   predicting invaded forest location and spread. At local scale, invasion
   is associated to abandoned fields nearby urban centers, roads and
   rivers.
   The invasion patterns of L. lucidum reflect the combined effect of
   historical socioeconomic connections between Asia and America, as well
   as the local cultural landscape history and configuration. Teleconnected
   cultural landscapes need to be explored as a theoretical framework for
   the study of biological invasions in the Anthropocene.},

Title = {Modelling habitat preference of an alien aquatic fern, Azolla

Abstract = {A crucial element in modelling habitat requirements of any alien plant
   species is selection of the most important predictive variables. A
   database consisting of measurements collected at 7 different sampling
   sites at Selkeh Wildlife Refuge (Anzali wetland, Iran) was applied to
   predict the habitat preferences of an exotic species, Azolla
   filiculoides (Lam.). The measured variables were a combination of
   physicochemical, structural-habitat and cover percentage data of A.
   filiculoides collected during the 2007-2008 period. We used support
   vector machines (SVMs) combined with two search algorithms, i.e. genetic
   algorithm (GA) and greedy stepwise (GS) in order to select the most
   important explanatory variables for the target species. The models with
   the best performing exponent were run five times after randomization to
   check the models' robustness and reproducibility. The results of paired
   Student's t-test showed that the two optimizers (GA and GS) were unable
   to improve the predictive performances of the SVMs. Yet, GA outperformed
   GS resulting in a better prediction. All applied methods showed that
   both structural-habitat and physico-chemical variables might play key
   roles for meeting the habitat preferences of the exotic fern in the
   wetland. However, structural-habitat parameters (particularly wetland
   depth and air temperature) were the most predictive ones. Among the
   water quality variables, orthophosphate and sulphate were also
   recognized as important predictors. The physico-chemical variables
   selected by the models revealed that reduction of industrial pollution
   loads and also decreasing nutrient and organic pollution inputs into the
   wetland could be effective way to reduce the growth of Azolla's
   population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Seeking the flowers for the bees: Integrating biotic interactions into
   niche models to assess the distribution of the exotic bee species
   Lithurgus huberi in South America},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {273},
Pages = {200-209},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {The wood-boring bee Lithurgus huberi Ducke (Apidae: Megachilinae:
   Lithurgini) is arguably an exotic species to South America. This
   solitary bee is the only representative in the Western Hemisphere of the
   Old World genus Lithurgus, and likely a conspecific with the
   Indo-Australian species Lithurgus atratus. L. huberi appears to have
   reached the continent at least 100 years ago, when it was discovered and
   described. Because this species seems to be oligolectic on pollen of
   Convolvulaceae flowers in South America, we attempted to integrate this
   biotic interaction (plant-bee relationships) to our species distribution
   model (SDM) procedures to predict its potential distribution in South
   America. The modeled distribution of seven L. huberi's host plant
   species did not improve the algorithms' ability to predict its
   distribution, but it produced constrained ranges. These results suggest
   that our biotic variables are not independent of the abiotic variables
   used (mostly related to climate). We employed five modeling algorithms,
   Envelope Score, GARP, Mahalanobis Distance, Support Vector Machines, and
   MaxEnt, but only the former two showed a good performance when
   predicting the occurrence of both, the host plant species and L. huberi.
   Our results indicate that this exotic pollinator is mainly distributed
   in eastern, northeastern, central, and southwestern South America, with
   few suitable areas in the Amazon region. We also highlight suitable
   areas for future surveys and present new occurrence records. (C) 2013

   Conservation planning},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {159},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids
   hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is
   severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock
   production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence
   that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The
   objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock
   predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and
   livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of
   risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We
   produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three
   algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively
   related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage,
   percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid
   vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of
   puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density,
   which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest
   and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an
   accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids;
   however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor
   predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out
   studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the
   identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation
   strategies most suitable for each one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Information-based summary statistics for spatial genetic structure
   inference},

Abstract = {The measurement of biodiversity at all levels of organization is an
   essential first step to understand the ecological and evolutionary
   processes that drive spatial patterns of biodiversity. Ecologists have
   explored the use of a large range of different summary statistics and
   have come to the view that information-based summary statistics, and in
   particular so-called Hill numbers, are a useful tool to measure
   biodiversity. Population geneticists, on the other hand, have focused
   largely on summary statistics based on heterozygosity and measures of
   allelic richness. However, recent studies proposed the adoption of
   information-based summary statistics in population genetics studies.
   Here, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the power of this
   family of summary statistics to inform regarding spatial patterns of
   genetic diversity and we compared it with that of traditional population
   genetics approaches, namely measures based on allelic richness and
   heterozygosity. To give an unbiased evaluation, we used three machine
   learning methods to test the performance of different sets of summary
   statistics to discriminate between spatial scenarios. We defined three
   distinct sets, (i) one based on allelic richness measures which included
   the Jaccard index, (ii) a set based on heterozygosity that included F-ST
   and (iii) a set based on Hill numbers derived from Shannon entropy,
   which included the recently proposed Shannon differentiation, Delta D.
   The results showed that the last of these performed as well or, under
   some specific spatial scenarios, even better than the traditional
   population genetics measures. Interestingly, we found that a rarely or
   never used genetic differentiation measure based on allelic richness,
   Jaccard dissimilarity (J), showed the highest discriminatory power to
   discriminate among spatial scenarios, followed by Shannon
   differentiation Delta D. We concluded, therefore, that information-based
   measures as well as Jaccard dissimilarity represent excellent additions
   to the population genetics toolkit.},

Title = {Predicting spatio-temporal distributions of migratory populations using
   Gaussian process modelling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1146-1156},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Knowledge concerning spatio-temporal distributions of populations is a
   prerequisite for successful conservation and management of migratory
   animals. Achieving cost-effective monitoring of large-scale movements is
   often difficult due to lack of effective and inexpensive methods. Taiga
   bean goose Anser fabalis fabalis and tundra bean goose A. f. rossicus
   offer an excellent example of a challenging management situation with
   harvested migratory populations. The subspecies have different
   conservation statuses and population trends. However, their distribution
   overlaps during migration to an unknown extent, which, together with
   their similar appearance, has created a conservation-management dilemma.
   Gaussian process (GP) models are widely adopted in the field of
   statistics and machine learning, but have seldom been applied in ecology
   so far. We introduce the R package gplite for GP modelling and use it in
   our case study together with birdwatcher observation data to study
   spatio-temporal differences between bean goose subspecies during
   migration in Finland in 2011-2019. We demonstrate that GP modelling
   offers a flexible and effective tool for analysing heterogeneous data
   collected by citizens. The analysis reveals spatial and temporal
   distribution differences between the two bean goose subspecies in
   Finland. Taiga bean goose migrates through the entire country, whereas
   tundra bean goose occurs only in a small area in south-eastern Finland
   and migrates later than taiga bean goose. Synthesis and applications.
   Within the studied bean goose populations, harvest can be targeted at
   abundant tundra bean goose by restricting hunting to south-eastern
   Finland and to the end of the migration period. In general, our approach
   combining citizen science data with GP modelling can be applied to study
   spatio-temporal distributions of various populations and thus help in
   solving challenging management situations. The introduced R package
   gplite can be applied not only to ecological modelling, but to a wide
   range of analyses in other fields of science.},

Title = {Animal communication of fear and safety related to foraging behavior and
   fitness: An individual-based modeling approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and
   courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this
   article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication
   impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations.
   We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between
   the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals
   become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that
   alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid
   predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed
   decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication
   resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity,
   suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is
   possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response
   to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally,
   that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to
   non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although
   there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication
   runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased
   foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased
   foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based
   estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision
   trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish
   communication runs from non-communication runs. In general,
   communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities,
   whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population
   densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the
   need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to
   defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was
   observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of
   fear of predators was low.},

Title = {Animal tracing with sulfur isotopes: Spatial segregation and climate
   variability in Africa likely contribute to population trends of a
   migratory songbird},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Climatic conditions affect animals but range-wide impacts at the
   population level remain largely unknown, especially in migratory
   species. However, studying climate-population relationships is still
   challenging in small migrants due to a lack of efficient and
   cost-effective geographic tracking method. Spatial distribution patterns
   of environmental stable isotopes (so called `isoscapes') generally
   overcome these limitations but none of the currently available isoscapes
   provide a substantial longitudinal gradient in species-rich sub-Saharan
   Africa. In this region, sulphur (delta S-34) has not been sufficiently
   explored on a larger scale. We developed a delta S-34 isoscape to trace
   animal origins in sub-Saharan Africa by coupling known-origin samples
   from tracked migratory birds with continental remotely sensed
   environmental data building on environment-delta S-34 relationships
   using a flexible machine learning technique. Furthermore, we link
   population-specific nonbreeding grounds with interannual climatic
   variation that might translate to breeding population trends. The
   predicted delta S-34 isotopic map featured east-west and coast-to-inland
   isotopic gradients and was applied to predict nonbreeding grounds of
   three breeding populations of Eurasian Reed Warblers Acrocephalus
   scirpaceus with two distinct migratory phenotypes. Breeding populations
   as well as migratory phenotypes exhibited large-scale segregation within
   the African nonbreeding range. These regions also differed substantially
   in the interannual climatic variation, with higher interannual
   variability in the eastern part of the range during 2001-2012. Over the
   same period, the eastern European breeding population seemed to have
   experienced a more steep decline in population size. The link between
   migratory patterns and large-scale climatic variability appears
   important to better understand population trajectories in many declining
   migratory animals. We believe animal tracing using sulphur isotopes will
   facilitate these efforts and offers manifold ecological and forensic
   applications in the biodiversity hotspot of sub-Saharan Africa.},

Title = {Some reflections on current invasion science and perspectives for an
   exciting future},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {79-100},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Species spreading beyond their native ranges are important study objects
   in ecology and environmental sciences and research on biological
   invasions is thriving. Along with an increase in the number of
   publications, the research field is experiencing an increase in the
   diversity of methods applied and questions asked. This development has
   facilitated an upsurge in information on invasions, but it also creates
   conceptual and practical challenges. To provide more transparency on
   which kind of research is actually done in the field, the distinction
   between invasion science, encompassing the full spectrum of studies on
   biological invasions and the sub-field of invasion biology, studying
   patterns and mechanisms of species invasions with a focus on biological
   research questions, can be useful. Although covering a smaller range of
   topics, invasion biology today still is the driving force in invasion
   science and we discuss challenges stemming from its embeddedness in the
   social context. Invasion biology consists of the building blocks
   `theory', `case studies' and `application', where theory takes the form
   of conceptual frameworks, major hypotheses and statistical
   generalisations. Referencing recent work in philosophy of science, we
   argue that invasion biology, like other biological or ecological
   disciplines, does not rely on the development of an all-encompassing
   theory in order to be efficient. We suggest, however, that theory
   development is nonetheless necessary and propose improvements. Recent
   advances in data visualisation, machine learning and semantic modelling
   are providing opportunities for enhancing knowledge management and
   presentation and we suggest that invasion science should use these to
   transform its ways of publishing, archiving and visualising research.
   Along with a stronger focus on studies going beyond purely biological
   questions, this would facilitate the efficient prevention and management
   of biological invasions.},

Title = {TRACKDEM: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and
   size distributions from videos in R},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {965-973},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. The possibilities for image analysis in scientific research are
   substantial: the costs of digital cameras and data storage are sharply
   decreasing, and automated image analyses greatly increase the scale,
   reproducibility and robustness of biological studies. However, automated
   image analysis in ecological and evolutionary studies is still in its
   infancy. There is a clear need for easy to use and accessible tools.
   2. Here, we provide a general purpose method to obtain estimates of
   population densities, individual body sizes and behavioural metrics from
   video material of moving organisms. The methods are supplied as a new
   R-package TRACKDEM, which provides a flexible, easy to install and use,
   generally applicable and accurate way to analyse ecological video data.
   The package can detect and track moving particles, count individuals and
   estimate individual sizes using background detection, particle
   identification and particle tracking algorithms. Machine learning is
   implemented to reduce the influence of noise in lower quality videos or
   to distinguish a single species in multi-species systems.
   3. We show that trackdem provides accurate population counts and body
   size distributions. Using a series of simulations, we show that our
   estimates are robust against high levels of noise in videos. When
   applied to live populations of Daphnia magna, our methods obtained
   accurate and unbiased estimates of population counts, individual sizes
   and size distributions, as verified by manual counting and measuring.
   The package trackdem is also directly usable for movement analysis, for
   instance in behavioural ecology, as illustrated by the tracking of
   insects, fish, cars and humans.
   4. Within 24 hr, we obtained 192 accurate population counts and body
   sizes of 22,154 individuals. Such results underscore that automated
   analysis can improve robustness and reproducibility, and greatly
   increase the scope of studies in ecology and evolution.},

Abstract = {Context Species are influenced by factors operating at multiple scales,
   but multi-scale species distribution and abundance models are rarely
   used. Though multi-scale species distribution models outperform
   single-scale models, when compared through model selection, multi- and
   single-scale models built with computer learning algorithms have not
   been compared. Objectives We compared the performance of models using a
   simple and accessible, multi-scale, machine learning, species
   distribution and abundance modeling framework to pseudo-optimized and
   unoptimized single-scale models. Methods We characterized environmental
   variables at four spatial scales and used boosted regression trees to
   build multi-scale and single-scale distribution and abundance models for
   28 bird species. For each species and across species, we compared the
   performance of multi-scale models to pseudo-optimized and
   lowest-performing unoptimized single-scale models. Results Multi-scale
   distribution models consistently performed as well or better than
   pseudo-optimized single-scale models and significantly better than
   unoptimized single-scale models. Abundance model performance showed a
   similar, but less pronounced pattern. Mixed-effects models, that
   controlled for species, provided strong evidence that multi-scale models
   performed better than unoptimized single-scale models. Although mean
   improvement in model performance across species appeared minor, for
   individual species, arbitrary selection of scale could result in
   discrepancies of up to fourteen percent for area of suitable habitat and
   population estimates. Conclusions Scale selection should be explicitly
   addressed in distribution and abundance modeling. The multi-scale
   species distribution and abundance modeling framework presented here
   provides a concise and accessible alternative to standard pseudo-scale
   optimization while addressing the scale-dependent response of species to
   their environment.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relative influence of variables on ecosystem responses
   and the dynamics of their effect is necessary for effective ecosystem
   monitoring and management. Also known as causal pathways analysis, we
   develop an approach using functional Principal Components Analysis
   (fPCA) and machine learning within a scenario analysis framework. fPCA
   is used to identify most influential variables for correlated,
   non-homogenoeus and nonlinear time series data characteristic of complex
   ecosystems. Hierarchical clustering of fPCA scores reveals groups of
   more homogeneous scenarios and similarly influential variables. The
   resultant subset of variables helps to overcome model identifiability
   problems when analysing time-lagged effects using Boosted Regression
   Trees (BRT). We use simulated data generated by a Dynamic Bayesian
   Network (DBN) of ecological windows for seagrass ecosystems given
   dredging stressors; 3,024 scenarios with 75 state variables are
   analysed. The BRT demonstrated a high level of fit (R2 approximate to
   0.97,MSE approximate to 0.16), supporting the validity of influential
   variables identified by fPCA. Influential variables identified included
   genus, location type, light, growth and seed. Six consecutive months of
   positive growth and adequate light were important for predicting states
   of high or moderate population. Compared to traditional scenario
   analysis and sensitivity analysis approaches, our approach
   simultaneously enabled capture of n-way interactions while accounting
   for time correlations. Although some variables and their dynamics agreed
   with existing knowledge, new variables and/or time lags of their effects
   were identified, corresponding to opportunities for further
   investigation as well as informing monitoring and management. Although
   we demonstrate our method on state variables with DBN simulated data, it
   is equally applicable to general time series data.},

Title = {Accelerated increase in vegetation carbon sequestration in China after

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {China has increased its vegetation coverage and enhanced its terrestrial
   carbon sink through ecological restoration since the end of the 20th
   century. However, the temporal variation in vegetation carbon
   sequestration remains unclear, and the relative effects of climate
   change and ecological restoration efforts are under debate. By
   integrating remote sensing and machine learning with a modelling
   approach, we explored the biological and physical pathways by which both
   climate change and human activities (e.g., ecological restoration,
   cropland expansion, and urbanization) have altered Chinese terrestrial
   ecosystem structures and functions, including vegetation cover, surface
   heat fluxes, water flux, and vegetation carbon sequestration (defined by
   gross and net primary production, GPP and NPP). Our study indicated that
   during 2001-2018, GPP in China increased significantly at a rate of
   49.1-53.1 TgC/yr(2), and the climatic and anthropogenic contributions to
   GPP gains were comparable (48\%-56\% and 44\%-52\%, respectively).
   Spatially, afforestation was the dominant mechanism behind forest cover
   expansions in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China, on the
   Loess Plateau and in the southwest karst region, whereas climate change
   promoted vegetation cover in most parts of southeastern China. At the
   same time, the increasing trend in NPP (22.4-24.9 TgC/yr(2)) during
   2001-2018 was highly attributed to human activities (71\%-81\%),
   particularly in southern, eastern, and northeastern China. Both GPP and
   NPP showed accelerated increases after 2010 because the anthropogenic
   NPP gains during 2001-2010 were generally offset by the climate-induced
   NPP losses in southern China. However, after 2010, the climatic
   influence reversed, thus highlighting the vegetation carbon
   sequestration that occurs with ecological restoration.},

Title = {Assessing the relative importance of temperature, discharge, and day
   length on the reproduction of an anadromous fish (Alosa alosa)},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change threatens anadromous fishes such as the allis shad (Alosa
   alosa) populations of which have declined since the 20th century in
   Europe. Sensitivity to climate change could be quantified by determining
   the fish's spawning behaviour, defined as the timing of reproduction
   (i.e. spawning events) as a function of temporally variable
   environmental factors. The cues that fish use to time reproduction could
   determine their response to climate change. A machine learning technique
   (boosted regression tree) was calibrated using a 14-year dataset
   composed of daily measures of environmental factors and fish occurrences
   during reproduction. The boosted regression tree provides complete
   insight into the complex relationship between the spawning probability,
   i.e. the probability for a fish to reproduce, and environmental factors
   that might evolve with climate change. The spawning probability was
   positively related to day length (44.6\%) and water temperature (34.7\%)
   and negatively related to river discharge (20.7\%). Optimal reproductive
   conditions corresponded to a difference in day length between 0 and 0.04
   hr, a water temperature between 15 and 26 degrees C and a river
   discharge between 55 and 665 m(3)/s; these conditions are currently
   being utilised by allis shad populations in the Garonne and Dordogne
   rivers, France. This study highlights the relative influence of
   environmental factors on the observed spawning period as well as the
   evolution of habitat suitability during the 14-year period. The novelty
   of this study stems from assessing population process data, i.e. the
   occurrence of fish reproduction, rather than mere occurrence data in an
   ecological niche model study. Climate change may lead to a shift in
   spawning phenology, as the water temperature and river discharge will
   also change. Therefore, conservation plans need to integrate these
   effects on spawning grounds.},

Title = {When is variable importance estimation in species distribution modelling
   affected by spatial correlation?},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {778-788},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Species distribution models are generic empirical techniques that have a
   number of applications. One of these applications is to determine which
   environmental conditions are most important for a species. The
   calculation of this variable importance depends on a number of
   assumptions, including that the observations that are used to estimate
   the models are independent of each other. Spatial autocorrelation, which
   is a common feature most environmental factors confounds this
   assumption. Besides, many species distribution models are trained using
   a number of explanatory variables that have different levels of spatial
   autocorrelation. In this study we quantified the effects of differences
   in spatial autocorrelation in explanatory variables and the type of
   species responses to environmental gradients on variable importance
   estimations in species distribution models. We simulated data for both
   environmental predictors and species, so that we were in control of the
   true contribution of every variable in the model and the importance that
   could be estimated after fitting the models. We found that spatial
   autocorrelation in the predictors inflated the variable importance
   estimates, but only when the response of species to the environmental
   gradients is linear. This inflation effect was larger when the
   environmental preferences of species coincided with the dominant
   environmental conditions in a study site. Additionally we find that
   unimodal responses to the predictors yield systematically a higher
   variable importance compared to linear responses. We conclude that the
   type of response to environmental conditions and the relative levels of
   spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables cause most bias
   in relative variable importance estimations. In this way, this study
   helps to clarify in a systematic and controlled approach how to make
   proper inferences about variable importance in species distribution
   models.},

   environmental variables, and the relationship may be difficult to
   quantify effectively. FBM, which combines species data, environmental
   data, expert experience, and machine learning, could reduce the data and
   system error. In the case of medicinal plant, Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)
   Diels, many approaches have been applied, including nine learning
   sequence of sampling sites, three FBM models, two types of information
   classification by fuzzy mathematical classification (FMC) and equal
   interval classification (EIC), and the evaluation of AIC and
   log-likelihood. Through the comparison of reasoning results between FBM
   and fuzzy matter element model (FME) in testing sites, the result shows
   that the combination of objective data and empirical model structure
   makes FBM have better result output. Besides, FBM sensitivity analysis
   helps researchers explore in detail the impact of environmental factors
   on each level of species habitat suitability. The temperature factor has
   an important influence on the highly suitable, moderately suitable, and
   lowly suitable habitats of A. sinensis. Through FMC and sensitivity
   analysis, annual mean temperature (Bio1) in 5.92 ?C-9.05 ?C and mean
   temperature of warmest quarter (Bio10) in 14.80 ?C-18.60 ?C are the
   highly suitable habitat temperature range of A. sinensis.},

Title = {An equation-free method reveals the ecological interaction networks
   within complex microbial ecosystems},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1774-1785},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Mapping the network of ecological interactions is a key to
   understanding the composition, stability, function and dynamics of
   microbial communities. In recent years various approaches have been used
   to reveal microbial interaction networks from metagenomic sequencing
   data, such as time-series analysis, machine learning and statistical
   techniques. Despite these efforts it is still not possible to capture
   details of the ecological interactions behind complex microbial
   dynamics.
   2. We developed the sparse S-map method (SSM), which generates a sparse
   interaction network from a multivariate ecological time series without
   presuming any mathematical formulation for the underlying microbial
   processes. The advantage of the SSM over alternative methodologies is
   that it fully utilizes the observed data using a framework of empirical
   dynamic modelling. This makes the SSM robust to non-equilibrium dynamics
   and underlying complexity (nonlinearity) in microbial processes.
   3. We showed that an increase in dataset size or a decrease in
   observational error improved the accuracy of SSM However, the accuracy
   of a comparative equation-based method was almost unchanged for both
   cases and equivalent to the SSM at best. Hence, the SSM outperformed a
   comparative equation-based method when datasets were large and the
   magnitude of observational errors was small. The results were robust to
   the magnitude of process noise and the functional forms of interspecific
   interactions that we tested. We applied the method to a microbiome data
   of six mice and found that there were different microbial interaction
   regimes between young to middle age (4-40week-old) and middle to old age
   (36-72week-old) mice.
   4. The complexity of microbial relationships impedes detailed
   equation-based modelling. Our method provides a powerful alternative
   framework to infer ecological interaction networks of microbial
   communities in various environments and will be improved by further
   developments in metagenomics sequencing technologies leading to
   increased dataset size and improved accuracy and precision.},

Title = {Long evolutionary history of an emerging fungal pathogen of diverse tree

Abstract = {Emerging plant pathogens have been increasing exponentially over the
   last century. To address this issue, it is critical to determine whether
   these pathogens are native to ecosystems or have been recently
   introduced. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes
   fostering emergence can help to manage their spread and predict
   epidemics/epiphytotics. Using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
   data, we studied genetic relationships, pathways of spread and the
   evolutionary history of Phellinus noxius, an emerging root-rotting
   fungus of unknown origin, in eastern Asia, Australia and the Pacific
   Islands. We analysed patterns of genetic variation using Bayesian
   inference, maximum-likelihood phylogeny, population splits and mixtures
   measuring correlations in allele frequencies and genetic drift, and
   finally applied coalescent-based theory using Approximate Bayesian
   computation (ABC) with supervised machine learning. Population structure
   analyses revealed five genetic groups with signatures of complex recent
   and ancient migration histories. The most probable scenario of ancient
   pathogen spread is movement from an unsampled population to Malaysia and
   the Pacific Islands, with subsequent spread to Taiwan and Australia.
   Furthermore, ABC analyses indicate P. noxius spread occurred thousands
   of generations ago, contradicting previous assumptions that this
   pathogen was recently introduced to multiple geographical regions. Our
   results suggest that recent emergence of P. noxius in eastern Asia,
   Australia and the Pacific Islands has probably been driven by
   anthropogenic and natural disturbances, such as deforestation, land-use
   change, severe weather events and/or introduction of exotic plants. This
   study provides a novel example of applying genome-wide allele frequency
   data to unravel the dynamics of pathogen emergence under changing
   ecosystem conditions.},

Title = {Identifying global and local drivers of change in mangrove cover and the

Abstract = {Background Climate change and human activities continue to drive a
   widespread decline in global mangrove coverage, undermining their
   capacity to provide ecosystem benefits. While global and local scale
   drivers of change on mangroves are widely acknowledged, the relative
   importance and the exposure of mangroves to climatic, geomorphological,
   and direct human threats vary spatially. Understanding the role and
   relative importance of the multiscale and multiple threats to mangroves
   and how these vary spatially is fundamental for formulating a spatially
   adaptive approach to their management and conservation. Aim Our study
   investigated the role of multiple threats on mangroves and the relative
   exposure. Location Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. Time period Recent
   past (2002-2019 and future (2050-2060). Major taxa studied Mangrove.
   Methods Using satellite-derived indicators of mangrove condition
   aggregated over 19 years (2002 to 2019) and 14 proxies of climate, human
   activity, and geomorphology, we applied machine learning methods to
   determine the role and relative importance of the change drivers. Using
   outputs from this deductive statistical process, we applied inductive
   methods to map mangrove exposure spatially. Results Model results
   highlight the importance of catchment erosion, human pressure, sea
   level, and macroclimate as the main drivers of the present-day
   ecological condition of mangroves in the WIO. Normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) was more sensitive to the identified drivers
   than the vegetation condition index (VCI), with the relative importance
   of variables varying across the two vegetation indicators. Main
   conclusions In anticipation of a stronger manifestation of climate
   change impacts, the resilience of mangroves in the WIO could be improved
   through adaptive management over time and space. Testing the efficacy of
   the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) is critical for understanding
   the mechanisms of ecosystem change and managing biodiversity change.},

Abstract = {Chironomidae spatial distribution was investigated at 63 near-pristine
   sites in 22 catchments of the Iberian Mediterranean coast. We used
   partial redundancy analysis to study Chironomidae community responses to
   a number of environmental factors acting at several spatial scales. The
   percentage of variation explained by local factors (23.3\%) was higher
   than that explained by geographical (8.5\%) or regional factors (8\%).
   Catchment area, longitude, pH, \% siliceous rocks in the catchment, and
   altitude were the best predictors of Chironomidae assemblages. We used a
   k-means cluster analysis to classified sites into 3 major groups based
   on Chironomidae assemblages. These groups were explained mainly by
   longitudinal zonation and geographical position, and were defined as 1)
   siliceous headwater streams, 2) mid-altitude streams with small
   catchment areas, and 3) medium-sized calcareous streams. Distinct
   species assemblages with associated indicator taxa were established for
   each stream category using IndVal analysis. Species responses to
   previously identified key environmental variables were determined, and
   optima and tolerances were established by weighted average regression.
   Distinct ecological requirements were observed among genera and among
   species of the same genus. Some genera were restricted to headwater
   systems (e.g., Diamesa), whereas others (e.g., Eukiefferiella) had wider
   ecological preferences but with distinct distributions among
   congenerics. In the present period of climate change, optima and
   tolerances of species might be a useful tool to predict responses of
   different species to changes in significant environmental variables,
   such as temperature and hydrology.},

Title = {An annotated set of audio recordings of Eastern North American birds
   containing frequency, time, and species information},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Acoustic recordings of soundscapes are an important category of audio
   data that can be useful for answering a variety of questions, and an
   entire discipline within ecology, dubbed ``soundscape ecology,{''} has
   risen to study them. Bird sound is often the focus of studies of
   soundscapes due to the ubiquitousness of birds in most terrestrial
   environments and their high vocal activity. Autonomous acoustic
   recorders have increased the quantity and availability of recordings of
   natural soundscapes while mitigating the impact of human observers on
   community behavior. However, such recordings are of little use without
   analysis of the sounds they contain. Manual analysis currently stands as
   the best means of processing this form of data for use in certain
   applications within soundscape ecology, but it is a laborious task,
   sometimes requiring many hours of human review to process comparatively
   few hours of recording. For this reason, few annotated data sets of
   soundscape recordings are publicly available. Further still, there are
   no publicly available strongly labeled soundscape recordings of bird
   sounds that contain information on timing, frequency, and species.
   Therefore, we present the first data set of strongly labeled bird sound
   soundscape recordings under free use license. These data were collected
   in the Northeastern United States at Powdermill Nature Reserve, Rector,
   Pennsylvania, USA. Recordings encompass 385 minutes of dawn chorus
   recordings collected by autonomous acoustic recorders between the months
   of April through July 2018. Recordings were collected in continuous
   bouts on four days during the study period and contain 48 species and
   16,052 annotations. Applications of this data set may be numerous and
   include the training, validation, and testing of certain advanced
   machine-learning models that detect or classify bird sounds. There are

Title = {Habitat-related seed germination traits in alpine habitats},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Volume = {8},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Understanding the key aspects of plant regeneration from seeds is
   crucial in assessing species assembly to their habitats. However, the
   regenerative traits of seed dormancy and germination are
   underrepresented in this context. In the alpine zone, the large species
   and microhabitat diversity provide an ideal context to assess
   habitat-related regenerative strategies. To this end, seeds of 53
   species growing in alpine siliceous and calcareous habitats (6230 and
   6170 of EU Directive 92/43, respectively) were exposed to different
   temperature treatments under controlled laboratory conditions.
   Germination strategies in each habitat were identified by clustering
   with k-means. Then, phylogenetic least squares correlations (PGLS) were
   fitted to assess germination and dormancy differences between species'
   main habitat (calcareous and siliceous), microhabitat (grasslands,
   heaths, rocky, and species with no specific microhabitats), and
   chorology (arctic-alpine and continental). Calcareous and siliceous
   grasslands significantly differ in their germination behaviour with a
   slow, mostly overwinter germination and high germination under all
   conditions, respectively. Species with high overwinter germination
   occurs mostly in heaths and have an arctic-alpine distribution.
   Meanwhile, species with low or high germinability in general inhabit in
   grasslands or have no specific microhabitat (they belong to generalist),
   respectively. Alpine species use different germination strategies
   depending on habitat provenance, species' main microhabitat, and
   chorotype. Such differences may reflect adaptations to local
   environmental conditions and highlight the functional role of
   germination and dormancy in community ecology.},

Title = {A Production-Living-Ecological Space Model for Land-Use Optimisation: A
   case study of the core Tumen River region in China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {437},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The study of production-living-ecological space (PLES) is essential for
   the sustainable use of land resources and regional socioeconomic
   development, and several studies have adopted PLES-based evaluation
   indices. However, few studies have investigated the effects of
   governmental regulation and human activity on the optimal allocation of
   land for different uses. Crucially, the non-optimal use of land by urban
   decision-makers leads to multiple problems including wasting potential
   land resources and trade-offs between economic development and
   environmental protection. Therefore, in this study, we developed a
   multi-spatial agent-based optimisation model (MSABOM) coupled with a
   multi-agent system (MAS) within a machine-learning framework. The MSABOM
   determines spatially optimised land-use solutions based on the
   small-scale land-use preferences of stakeholders, and addresses
   conflicts in the sub-optimal allocation of resources based on the
   behaviours of model agents and the decision-making environment. The
   Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China was used as a case study
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The results show that
   (1) the MSABOM can significantly improve the optimisation of PLES,
   improving the land utilisation rate by 1.22 times; (2) based on an
   understanding of existing practices, the optimal allocation plan
   obtained by the agent-based model is more suitable than that obtained by
   a non-agent-based model; (3) multi-functional land-use patterns can be
   optimally allocated in space and time, which is extremely useful for
   coordinating stakeholder participation and addressing conflicts of
   interest in land-use behaviours; and (4) an urban spatial development
   coefficient was successfully used to determine the dominant function and
   functional positioning of PLES, which helps ensure flexible development
   strategies for spatial planning.},

Title = {Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture Through Camera Trapping: A Review
   of Benchmark Analyses for Wildlife Density Estimation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {Camera traps have become an important research tool for both
   conservation biologists and wildlife managers. Recent advances in
   spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have increasingly
   put camera traps at the forefront of population monitoring programs.
   These methods allow for benchmark analysis of species density without
   the need for invasive fieldwork techniques. We conducted a review of
   SECR studies using camera traps to summarize the current focus of these
   investigations, as well as provide recommendations for future studies
   and identify areas in need of future investigation. Our analysis shows a
   strong bias in species preference, with a large proportion of studies
   focusing on large felids, many of which provide the only baseline
   estimates of population density for these species. Furthermore, we found
   that a majority of studies produced density estimates that may not be
   precise enough for long-term population monitoring. We recommend
   simulation and power analysis be conducted before initiating any
   particular study design and provide examples using readily available
   software. Furthermore, we show that precision can be increased by
   including a larger study area that will subsequently increase the number
   of individuals photo-captured. As many current studies lack the
   resources or manpower to accomplish such an increase in effort, we
   recommend that researchers incorporate new technologies such as
   machine-learning, web-based data entry, and online deployment management
   into their study design. We also cautiously recommend the potential of
   citizen science to help address these study design concerns. In
   addition, modifications in SECR model development to include species
   that have only a subset of individuals available for individual
   identification (often called mark-resight models), can extend the
   process of explicit density estimation through camera trapping to
   species not individually identifiable.},

Title = {Continuous-surface geographic assignment of migratory animals using
   strontium isotopes: A case study with monarch butterflies},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2445-2457},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) have shown promise for tracing
   the geographic origin of animal tissues because they have
   high-resolution and show discrete spatial patterns independent and
   complementary to those of light isotopes. In this study, we provide a
   complete quantitative framework to apply Sr-87/Sr-86 for tracking
   migratory animals using the eastern North American population of monarch
   butterflies Danaus plexippus as a case study.
   2. To enable continuous-surface geographic assignment using Sr-87/Sr-86,
   we recommend following five key steps: (a) assessing feasibility, (b)
   sample collection, (c) laboratory analysis, (d) modelling the isoscape
   and (e) geographic assignment. We provide a detailed outline of these
   steps and then focus on steps 3-5 for the case study. For monarchs,
   using an extensive plant Sr-87/Sr-86 dataset (n = 400), geospatial data
   and a machine learning approach, we first calibrate a regional,
   high-resolution Sr-87/Sr-86 isoscape (i.e. a baseline for Sr-87/Sr-86
   assignment) over their eastern North American summer breeding range. We
   then use the Sr-87/Sr-86 isoscape to estimate the posterior probability
   surface of natal origin for 100 monarchs of unknown origin.
   3. Our results demonstrate that Sr-87/Sr-86 can greatly improve the
   precision of isotope-based geographic assignment. Furthermore, combining
   delta H-2 and Sr-87/Sr-86 into a dual assignment provides the most
   constrained area of natal origin.
   4. We provide a framework for ecologists and palaeoecologists to apply
   Sr-87/Sr-86-based geographic assignments for animal movement studies
   using contemporary or archived samples. The addition of the Sr-87/Sr-86
   assignment tool will enhance our ability to study migration and
   dispersal in a wide variety of animals.},

Title = {Can singing rate be used to predict male breeding status of forest
   songbirds? A comparison of three calibration models},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {For male songbirds, song rate varies throughout the breeding season and
   is correlated with breeding cycle stages. Although these patterns have
   been well documented, this relationship has not been used to predict a
   bird's breeding status from acoustic monitoring. This challenge of using
   a response (i.e., behavior) to indirectly measure an underlying
   biological state is common in ecology, but correctly addressing the
   associated statistical challenge of calibration is rare. The objective
   of this study was to determine whether variation in song rate can be
   used to predict the breeding status of the Olive-sided Flycatcher
   (Contopus cooperi). In 2016, song rates from 28 male Olive-sided
   Flycatchers were collected from human observers (n = 545 five-minute
   counts) and breeding status (i.e., single, paired, and feeding young)
   was monitored throughout the breeding season. The predictive ability of
   three modeling approaches-regression, hierarchical, and a classification
   tree-was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity to determine the
   best modeling approach. The hierarchical model was the best at
   predicting all three breeding status classes, with a mean sensitivity of
   69\%, compared with 54\% and 50\% from the regression and machine
   learning models, respectively. Our results suggest that song rate can be
   used as an indirect measurement of breeding status in the Olive-sided
   Flycatcher when using a hierarchical modeling approach to calibrate the
   breeding status-song rate relationship. This novel modeling approach
   provides a cost-effective tool to collect much needed demographic
   information over large spatial extents and inform species status
   assessments, recovery strategies, and management plans for species of
   conservation concern.},

Abstract = {Global environmental change is a pressing issue as evidenced by the rise
   of extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world, threatening
   the survival of vulnerable species and habitats. Effective monitoring of
   climatic and anthropogenic impacts is therefore critical to safeguarding
   ecosystems, and it would allow us to better understand their response to
   stressors and predict long-term impacts. Ecological networks provide a
   biomonitoring framework for examining the system-level response and
   functioning of an ecosystem, but have been, until recently, constrained
   by limited empirical data due to the laborious nature of their
   construction. Hence, most experimental designs have been confined to a
   single network or a small number of replicate networks, resulting in
   statistical uncertainty, low resolution, limited spatiotemporal scale
   and oversimplified assumptions.
   Advances in data sampling and curation methodologies, such as
   next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the Internet `Cloud', have
   facilitated the emergence of the `Big Data' phenomenon in Ecology,
   enabling the construction of ecological networks to be carried out
   effectively and efficiently. This provides to ecologists an excellent
   opportunity to expand the way they study ecological networks. In
   particular, highly replicated networks are now within our grasp if new
   NGS technologies are combined with machine learning to develop network
   building methods. A replicated network approach will allow temporal and
   spatial variations embedded in the data to be taken into consideration,
   overcoming the limitations in the current `single network' approach.
   We are still at the embryonic stage in exploring replicated networks,
   and with these new opportunities we also face new challenges. In this
   chapter, we discuss some of these challenges and highlight potential
   approaches that will help us build and analyse replicated networks to
   better understand how complex ecosystems operate, and the services and
   functioning they provide, paving the way for deciphering ecological big
   data reliably in the future.},

Title = {Unsupervised dictionary extraction of bird vocalisations and new tools

Abstract = {A broad range of organisations and individuals are collecting wildlife
   audio recordings. Huge amounts of audio data have been gathered in the
   past and since the popularisation of automatic recording units the data
   are piling up exponentially. The point in gathering them is to analyse
   them, evaluate insights and hypotheses, identify patterns of activity
   that are otherwise not apparent and finally design policies on
   biodiversity issues. For massive volumes of data even visual inspection
   of spectrograms is unfeasible and interesting cases that could provide
   valuable insight for concrete hypotheses on the biodiversity status can
   slip into bliss. In this paper we research a range of techniques that
   work with minor human supervision. These techniques will construct a
   dictionary of templates extracted in an unsupervised way from reference
   recordings and then crawl over a large number of recordings to examine
   the underlying bioacoustic activity. This work is general and we have
   applied it to many datasets of animal's vocalisations (e.g. cetaceans,
   mice, birds). To test our tools objectively and for the sake of
   reproducibility in this work we report on the MLSP 2013 bird dataset
   that recently has been publicly released along with all its annotations.
   We are not interested as to which is the best scoring approach for this
   dataset Our aim is to describe novel machine learning tools that try to
   refine our understanding of biodiversity by answering questions such as:
   Is the recording under examination void of bird vocalisations or not? If
   there is bird activity, how many different species are in the recording?
   What are the most important characteristic spectral segments for
   recognizing a specific species? The database however is valuable to us
   to quantify our findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Solving the maximum representation problem to prioritize areas for the
   conservation of terrestrial mammals at risk in Oaxaca},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {493-508},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Oaxaca, located in south-west Mexico within the Mesoamerican
   biodiversity hotspot, holds exceptionally high biodiversity for several
   taxa, including mammals. It has four decreed natural protected areas
   (NPAs) covering 5\% of its total area, but only three of these, covering
   only 0.2\% of the area, are strictly protected as National Parks. The
   current study develops ecological niche models for 183 terrestrial
   mammals for use as biodiversity surrogates in a systematic conservation
   planning exercise. Forty-five of these species were selected on the
   basis of their being either endangered or threatened or otherwise listed
   under the Mexican Red List or because they were endemic to either Oaxaca
   or to Mexico. The niche models were constructed with a machine-learning
   algorithm (GARP, Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction) and refined
   by restricting each model to sites with suitable vegetation and habitat
   patches contiguous with known occurrences of the species. If the entire
   predicted geographical distribution of each of the 45 species listed
   above is put under protection, the entire state of Oaxaca gets included.
   Therefore, we imposed different constraints on the maximum area that can
   be put under protection (5-30\% of the area of Oaxaca) and selected
   nominal conservation area networks based on different percentage
   representation targets for the species' modelled distributions based on
   their conservation status (10-100\%). The area selection utilized a
   rarity- and complementarity-based algorithm (in the ResNet software
   package). The goal was to have as many as possible of the 45 species at
   risk meet their specified representation targets in the budgeted area.
   The methods developed here combine ecological niche modelling and area
   prioritization algorithms for integrated conservation planning in a
   protocol that is suitable for other highly biodiverse regions.},

Title = {Predicting the distribution of foraging seabirds during a period of
   heightened environmental variability},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Quantifying the links between the marine environment, prey occurrence,
   and predator distribution is the first step towards identifying areas of
   biological importance for marine spatial planning. Events such as marine
   heatwaves result in an anomalous change in the physical environment,
   which can lead to shifts in the structure, biomass, and distribution of
   lower trophic levels. As central-place foragers, seabirds are vulnerable
   to changes in their foraging grounds during the breeding season. We
   first quantified spatiotemporal variability in the occurrence and
   biomass of prey in response to an abrupt change in oceanography as a
   result of a marine heatwave event. Secondly, using multivariate
   techniques and machine learning, we investigated if differences in the
   foraging technique and prey of seabirds resulted in varying responses to
   changes in prey occurrence and the environment over a 2.5-yr period. We
   found that the main variables correlated with seabird distribution were
   also important in structuring the occurrence and biomass of prey;
   sea-surface temperature (SST), current speed, mixed-layer depth, and
   bathymetry. Both zooplankton biomass and the occurrence of fish schools
   exhibited negative relationships with temperature, and temperature was
   subsequently an important variable in determining seabird distribution.
   We were able to establish correlations between the distribution of prey
   and the spatiotemporal distribution of albatross, little penguins and
   common-diving petrels. We were unable to find a correlation between the
   distribution of prey and that of short-tailed shearwaters and fairy
   prions. For high-use coastal areas, the delineation of important
   foraging regions is essential to balance human use of an area with the
   needs of marine predators, particularly seabirds.},

Title = {The challenge of modeling niches and distributions for data-poor
   species: a comprehensive approach to model complexity},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {726-736},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Models of species ecological niches and geographic distributions now
   represent a widely used tool in ecology, evolution, and biogeography.
   However, the very common situation of species with few available
   occurrence localities presents major challenges for such modeling
   techniques, in particular regarding model complexity and evaluation.
   Here, we summarize the state of the field regarding these issues and
   provide a worked example using the technique Maxent for a small mammal
   endemic to Madagascar (the nesomyine rodent Eliurus majori). Two
   relevant model-selection approaches exist in the literature (information
   criteria, specifically AICc; and performance predicting withheld data,
   via a jackknife), but AICc is not strictly applicable to
   machine-learning algorithms like Maxent. We compare models chosen under
   each selection approach with those corresponding to Maxent default
   settings, both with and without spatial filtering of occurrence records
   to reduce the effects of sampling bias. Both selection approaches chose
   simpler models than those made using default settings. Furthermore, the
   approaches converged on a similar answer when sampling bias was taken
   into account, but differed markedly with the unfiltered occurrence data.
   Specifically, for that dataset, the models selected by AICc had
   substantially fewer parameters than those identified by performance on
   withheld data. Based on our knowledge of the study species, models
   chosen under both AICc and withheld-data-selection showed higher
   ecological plausibility when combined with spatial filtering. The
   results for this species intimate that AICc may consistently select
   models with fewer parameters and be more robust to sampling bias. To
   test these hypotheses and reach general conclusions, comprehensive
   research should be undertaken with a wide variety of real and simulated
   species. Meanwhile, we recommend that researchers assess the critical
   yet underappreciated issue of model complexity both via information
   criteria and performance on withheld data, comparing the results between
   the two approaches and taking into account ecological plausibility.},

Title = {Cross validation for model selection: A review with examples from
   ecology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Specifying, assessing, and selecting among candidate statistical models
   is fundamental to ecological research. Commonly used approaches to model
   selection are based on predictive scores and include information
   criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, and cross validation.
   Based on data splitting, cross validation is particularly versatile
   because it can be used even when it is not possible to derive a
   likelihood (e.g., many forms of machine learning) or count parameters
   precisely (e.g., mixed-effects models). However, much of the literature
   on cross validation is technical and spread across statistical journals,
   making it difficult for ecological analysts to assess and choose among
   the wide range of options. Here we provide a comprehensive, accessible
   review that explains important-but often overlooked-technical aspects of
   cross validation for model selection, such as: bias correction,
   estimation uncertainty, choice of scores, and selection rules to
   mitigate overfitting. We synthesize the relevant statistical advances to
   make recommendations for the choice of cross-validation technique and we
   present two ecological case studies to illustrate their application. In
   most instances, we recommend using exact or approximate leave-one-out
   cross validation to minimize bias, or otherwise k-fold with bias
   correction if k < 10. To mitigate overfitting when using cross
   validation, we recommend calibrated selection via our recently
   introduced modified one-standard-error rule. We advocate for the use of
   predictive scores in model selection across a range of typical modeling
   goals, such as exploration, hypothesis testing, and prediction, provided
   that models are specified in accordance with the stated goal. We also
   emphasize, as others have done, that inference on parameter estimates is
   biased if preceded by model selection and instead requires a carefully
   specified single model or further technical adjustments.},

Title = {Understanding the temporal dynamics of estimated environmental niche
   hypervolumes for marine fishes},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Understanding how species respond to the environment is essential in
   ecology, evolution, and conservation. Abiotic factors can influence
   species responses and the multi-dimensional space of abiotic factors
   that allows a species to grow represents the environmental niche. While
   niches are often assumed to be constant and robust, they are most likely
   changing over time and estimation can be influenced by population
   biology, sampling intensity, and computation methodology. Here, we used
   a 12-year time series of survey data to fit annual ecological niche
   models (ENMs) for 10 marine fish species by using two regression and two
   machine learning algorithms to evaluate the variation and
   differentiation of environmental niches. Fitted ENMs were used to
   develop multi-dimensional annual and pooled hypervolumes that were
   evaluated over time and across ENM algorithms, species, and years by
   computing volume, distance, and dissimilarity metrics for each annual
   estimated niche. We then investigated potential drivers of estimated
   hypervolume dynamics including species abundance, species occurrence,
   sampling effort, salinity, red tides severity, and algorithm. Overall,
   our results revealed that estimated niches varied over time and across
   ENM, species, and algorithms. Niche estimation was influenced over time
   by multiple factors suggesting high complexity on niche dynamics
   interpretation. Species with high occurrence tended to have a closer
   representation of the pooled niche and years with higher abundance
   tended to produce niche expansion. ENM algorithm, sampling effort,
   seawater salinity, and red tides explained the deviations from the
   pooled niche. Greater sampling effort led to more comprehensive and
   complete estimates of species niches. High red tides severity triggered
   niche contraction. Our results emphasize the predictable effects of
   population, sampling, and environment on species niche estimation and
   interpretation, and that each should be considered when performing and
   interpreting ecological niche analyses. Our niche analysis approach may
   contribute to effectively quantifying and assessing niche dynamics.},

Title = {Application of tri-axial accelerometer data to the interpretation of
   movement and behaviour of threatened black cockatoos},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {100-110},
Abstract = {Context Carnaby's (Calvptorhychus latirostris), Baudin's
   (Calyptorhynchus baudinii) and forest red-tailed black cockatoos
   (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso) are threatened parrot species endemic to
   south-western Australia. Behavioural monitoring has previously involved
   direct observation, which has proven challenging because of their
   cryptic nature, the type of habitat they move through and their speed of
   movement. The development of a model to accurately classify behaviour
   from tri-axial accelerometer data will provide greater insight into
   black cockatoo behaviour and ecology.
   Aims. To develop an automated classifier model to classify accelerometer
   data from released black cockatoos to determine behaviour and activity
   budgets for three species of black cockatoo.
   Methods. In the present study, we attached tri-axial accelerometers,
   housed in GPS tags, to four Camaby's cockatoos, three forest red-tailed
   black cockatoos and two Baudin's cockatoos in captive care, undergoing
   rehabilitation for release back to the wild. Accelerometer data from
   these birds was coupled with 19 video files of the birds' behaviour when
   flying, feeding and resting, to develop an automated behaviour
   classifier. The classifier was then used to annotate accelerometer data
   from 15 birds released after successful rehabilitation and to calculate
   activity budgets for these birds post-release.
   Key results. We developed a classifier able to identify resting, flying
   and foraging behaviours from accelerometer data with 86\% accuracy, as
   determined by the percentage of observed behaviours correctly identified
   by the classifier. The application of the classifier to accelerometer
   data from 15 released cockatoos enabled us to determine behaviours and
   activity budgets for all three species of black cockatoo. Black
   cockatoos spent most of their time at rest, followed by foraging with a
   short period of time flying.
   Conclusions. Application of the classifier to data from released birds
   gives researchers the ability to remotely identify patterns of behaviour
   and calculate activity budgets.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {573},

Abstract = {Few studies have examined the foraging ecology of top marine predators
   by taking into account the vertical and horizontal dimensions
   simultaneously. In this study, using 3-dimensional reconstruction of
   underwater animal paths, we investigated the relationship between area
   restricted search (ARS) and foraging behaviors in the southern elephant
   seal Mirounga leonina. We equipped 6 post-breeding females on the
   Kerguelen Islands with an Acousonde (TM) recording simultaneously
   sounds, pressure, acceleration and magnetic field-strength in
   3-dimensions (n = 879 dives). Using the spherical first passage time
   analysis, we identified ARS in 46.4\% of the dives. They represented
   36.9\% of the bottom time, but due to a higher prey encounter rate,
   67.6\% of catch attempts took place in ARS. These areas, occurring
   within a sphere of 48.2 +/- 25.7 m radius, were characterized by an
   increase in energy expenditure and a strong variability in the roll and
   heading compared to non-ARS regions. While within an ARS, we identified
   3 hunting modes from unsupervised classification based on acceleration
   properties previous to captures. We found that 32.8\% of attempts
   matched a passive-gliding approach from above the target. The other 2
   modes corresponded to an actively swimming approach associated with
   increases of variance in heading and/or rolling movements for the first
   one (56.6\% of captures), and to a much larger swimming effort for the
   second one (10.6\% of captures). These data revealed a strong link
   between seals' fine-scale movements and feeding activity, suggesting
   that seals fed mainly on patchily distributed re sources, with different
   hunting strategies that may be indicative of several prey species
   targeted.},

Title = {BEMOVI, software for extracting behavior and morphology from videos,

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2584-2595},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and provide vital
   services (e.g., photosynthesis, decomposition, nutrient recycling). From
   the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of
   functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging,
   because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In
   addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and
   behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions
   between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and
   genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are
   promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect
   of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video
   analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance
   and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing
   dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to
   describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a
   package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance,
   morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a
   video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present
   in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and
   time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a
   modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for
   peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms
   features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be
   distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and
   accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies
   communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between
   manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series
   of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We
   further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning
   to automatically classify individuals into species and that information
   on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.},

Title = {Dealing with uncertain absences in habitat modelling: a case study of a
   rare ground-dwelling parrot},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Pages = {704-713},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the development of a species distribution model based on regression
   techniques such as generalized linear or additive modelling (GLM/GAM), a
   basic assumption is that records of species presence and absence are
   real. However, a common concern in many studies examining species
   distributions is that absences cannot be inferred with certainty. This
   is particularly the case where the species is rare, difficult to detect
   and/or does not occupy all available habitat considered suitable. The
   western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris) of southern
   Western Australia, Australia, is a case in point, as not only is it rare
   and difficult to detect, but it is also unlikely to occupy all available
   suitable habitat. A recent survey of ground parrots provided the
   opportunity to develop a predictive distribution model. As the data were
   susceptible to false absences, these were replaced with randomly
   selected ` pseudo' absences and modelled using GLM. As a comparison,
   presence-only information was modelled using a relatively new approach,
   MAXENT, a machine-learning technique that has been shown to perform
   comparatively well. The predictive performance of both models, as
   assessed by the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) was high
   (AUC > 0.8), with MAXENT performing only marginally better than the GLM.
   These approaches both indicated that the ground parrot prefers areas
   relatively high in altitude, distant from rivers, gently sloping to
   level habitat, with an intermediate cover of vegetation and where there
   is a mosaic of vegetation ages. In this case, the use of presence-only
   information resulted in the identification of important environmental
   attributes defining the occurrence of the ground parrot, but additional
   factors that account for the inability of the bird to occupy all
   suitable habitat should be a component of model refinement.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Storm-petrels have been shown to use dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a
   foraging cue, suggesting that this compound may be used to predict their
   distribution. We describe a new distribution model that employs machine
   learning software and geographic information systems to model
   storm-petrel distribution. We used environmental predictor variables
   that included newly available climatologies of sea surface DMS
   concentrations to construct distribution maps of fork-tailed
   storm-petrel (Oceanodroma furcata) and Leach's storm-petrel (O.
   leucorhoa) in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. Model accuracy was
   assessed by (1) using the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) values and (2) comparing predicted
   distributions to presence and non-detection data from two opportunistic
   pelagic surveys performed in summer 2008. Models using all predictor
   variables gave AUC values of 0.89 and 0.75, sensitivity values of 0.73
   and 0.61, and specificity values of 0.83 and 0.73 for fork-tailed and
   Leach's storm-petrel, respectively. Models using all predictor variables
   except DMS gave AUC values of 0.87 and 0.74, sensitivity values of 0.81
   and 0.60, and specificity values of 0.77 for fork-tailed and Leach's
   storm-petrel, respectively. The large-scale link between DMS and how
   storm-petrels use it to locate foraging areas was reinforced by the
   partial dependence of DMS on the relative index of occurrence (RIO) of
   storm-petrels, and by a decrease in AUC values when removing DMS as a
   predictor. This work is a preliminary step toward linking seabird
   distribution to globally important infochemicals and should be a basis
   for further study.},

Title = {Assessing the application of a geographic presence-only model for land
   suitability mapping},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Pages = {257-269},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent advances in ecological modeling have focused on novel methods for
   characterizing the environment that use presence-only data and
   machine-learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of species
   occurrence. These novel methods may have great potential for land
   suitability applications in the developing world where detailed land
   cover information is often unavailable or incomplete. This paper
   assesses the adaptation and application of the presence-only geographic
   species distribution model, MaxEnt, for agricultural crop suitability
   mapping in a rural Thailand where lowland paddy rice and upland field
   crops predominant. To assess this modeling approach, three independent
   crop presence datasets were used including a social-demographic survey
   of farm households, a remote sensing classification of land use/land
   cover, and ground control points, used for geodetic and thematic
   reference that vary in their geographic distribution and sample size.
   Disparate environmental data were integrated to characterize
   environmental settings across Nang Rang District, a region of
   approximately 1300 sq. km in size. Results indicate that the MaxEnt
   model is capable of modeling crop suitability for upland and lowland
   crops, including rice varieties, although model results varied between
   datasets due to the high sensitivity of the model to the distribution of
   observed crop locations in geographic and environmental space. Accuracy
   assessments indicate that model outcomes were influenced by the sample
   size and the distribution of sample points in geographic and
   environmental space. The need for further research into accuracy
   assessments of presence-only models lacking true absence data is
   discussed. We conclude that the MaxEnt model can provide good estimates
   of crop suitability, but many areas need to be carefully scrutinized
   including geographic distribution of input data and assessment methods
   to ensure realistic modeling results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Decoupled conservatism of Grinnellian and Eltonian niches in an invasive
   arthropod},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {1},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Whether a species niche is conserved or shifts across space and time is
   a question of heightened interest in ecology and evolution. Considerable
   scientific inquiry into this topic has used invasive species to evaluate
   conservatism of the Grinnellian climatic niche while generally
   neglecting the Eltonian functional niche. By contrast, we report here on
   the first simultaneous reciprocal comparison of both the Grinnellian and
   Eltonian niches for the globally invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus
   leniusculus between its native (Pacific Northwest of North America) and
   non-native ranges (Japan). Using multivariate statistics and the Maxent
   machine-learning algorithm, we found strong evidence for a climatic
   niche shift between geographic regions for P. leniusculus. Pacifastacus
   leniusculus shifted from warmer temperatures with strong precipitation
   seasonality in western North America to cooler temperatures with less
   precipitation seasonality in Japan. However, analysis of stable isotopes
   of carbon and nitrogen revealed conservatism of the functional niche of
   P. leniusculus between multiple lakes in the native and non-native
   ranges. We found that trophic position and niche width of P. leniusculus
   were equivalent between regions, and that niche attributes including
   reliance on autochthonous or allochthonous energy sources and
   ontogenetic shifts were comparable regardless of origin. Our finding of
   functional niche conservatism contrasts with the results of some recent
   studies evaluating the Grinnellian niche for invasive species, as well
   as our own climatic niche comparison, and raises the question of whether
   Grinnellian or Eltonian niches are more prone to shifts or conservatism.
   We hypothesize that the Grinnellian niche may be more labile than the
   Eltonian niche in general, but argue that resolving this question will
   require more reciprocal comparisons of Eltonian niches to keep pace with
   the recent increase in Grinnellian niche studies.},

Title = {Ecological niches as stable distributional constraints on mammal
   species, with implications for Pleistocene extinctions and climate
   change projections for biodiversity},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {305-314},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim Theoretical work suggests that species' ecological niches should
   remain relatively constant over long-term ecological time periods, but
   empirical tests are few. We present longitudinal studies of 23 extant
   mammal species, modelling ecological niches and predicting geographical
   distributions reciprocally between the Last Glacial Maximum and present
   to test this evolutionary conservatism.
   Location This study covered distributional shifts in mammal species
   across the lower 48 states of the United States.
   Methods We used a machine-learning tool for modelling species'
   ecological niches, based on known occurrences and electronic maps
   summarizing ecological dimensions, to assess the ability of ecological
   niches as modelled in one time period to predict the geographical
   distribution of the species in another period, and vice versa.
   Results High intertemporal predictivity between niche models and
   species' occurrences indicate that niche conservatism is widespread
   among the taxa studied, particularly when statistical power is
   considered as a reason for failure of reciprocal predictions. Niche
   projections to the present for 8 mammal taxa that became extinct at the
   end of the Pleistocene generally increased in area, and thus do not
   support the hypothesis of niche collapse as a major driving force in
   their extinction.
   Main conclusions Ecological niches represent long-term stable
   constraints on the distributional potential of species; indeed, this
   study suggests that mammal species have tracked consistent climate
   profiles throughout the drastic climate change events that marked the
   end of the Pleistocene glaciations. Many current modelling efforts
   focusing on anticipating climate change effects on species' potential
   geographical distributions will be bolstered by this result - in
   essence, the first longitudinal demonstration of niche conservatism.},

Title = {Neutral processes related to regional bee commonness and dispersal

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Understanding how niche-based and neutral processes contribute to the
   spatial variation in plant-pollinator interactions is central to
   designing effective pollination conservation schemes. Such schemes are
   needed to reverse declines of wild bees and other pollinating insects,
   and to promote pollination services to wild and cultivated plants. We
   used data on wild bee interactions with plants belonging to the four
   tribes Loteae, Trifolieae, Anthemideae and either spring- or
   summer-flowering Cichorieae, sampled systematically along a 682 km
   latitudinal gradient to build models that allowed us to 1) predict
   occurrences of pairwise bee-flower interactions across 115 sampling
   locations, and 2) estimate the contribution of variables hypothesized to
   be related to niche-based assembly structuring processes (viz. annual
   mean temperature, landscape diversity, bee sociality, bee phenology and
   flower preferences of bees) and neutral processes (viz. regional
   commonness and dispersal distance to conspecifics). While neutral
   processes were important predictors of plant-pollinator distributions,
   niche-based processes were reflected in the contrasting distributions of
   solitary bee and bumble bees along the temperature gradient, and in the
   influence of bee flower preferences on the distribution of bee species
   across plant types. In particular, bee flower preferences separated bees
   into three main groups, albeit with some overlap: visitors to
   spring-flowering Cichorieae; visitors to Anthemideae and
   summer-flowering Cichorieae; and visitors to Trifolieae and Loteae. Our
   findings suggest that both neutral and niche-based processes are
   significant contributors to the spatial distribution of plant-pollinator
   interactions so that conservation actions in our region should be
   directed towards areas: near high concentrations of known occurrences of
   regionally rare bees; in mild climatic conditions; and that are
   surrounded by heterogenous landscapes. Given the observed niche-based
   differences, the proportion of functionally distinct plants in
   flower-mixes could be chosen to target bee species, or guilds, of
   conservation concern.},

Abstract = {Increased wildfire activity and climate change have intensified
   disturbance regimes globally and have raised concern among scientists
   and land managers about the resilience of disturbed landscapes. Here we
   test the effects of climate, topographic variation and pre-fire stand
   structure on regeneration in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var.
   latifolia) forests following high-severity fire over the past seven
   decades. We surveyed lodgepole pine regeneration 8-67 years after eight
   high-severity fires in western Colorado and southern Wyoming. We used
   dendroecological methods and machine learning to (a) identify temporal
   trends in post-fire regeneration and (b) examine influences of climate
   on post-fire regeneration, with focus on post-fire establishment,
   initial post-fire density and radial growth. All burned sites reached a
   median stocking density of >= 150 seedlings/ ha, but there was a large
   range of spatial heterogeneity, with regeneration being absent or scarce
   in many plots, implying a trend of increasing patchiness with likely
   cascading effects on subsequent patterns and processes. Our analysis
   indicated that (a) post-fire regeneration is influenced by pre-fire
   stand structure (stand age and density), elevation and post-fire minimum
   temperature; (b) pre-fire densities of >14,000 stems/ha promoted
   successful stocking (>= 150 seedlings/ha) and reduced lag between the
   disturbance and initial regeneration; and (c) minimum post-fire
   temperatures >-1.6 degrees C reduced lag of initial regeneration and
   promoted initial radial growth. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that
   lodgepole pine in high-elevation forests are regenerating following
   fires under recent climatic trends, but that regeneration is affected by
   post-fire climatic conditions. Importantly, forest patchiness may be
   increasing in a way that affects future ecological dynamics and may
   compromise the resilience of these systems.},

Title = {Application of multidimensional structural characterization to detect
   and describe moderate forest disturbance},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The study of vegetation community and structural change has been central
   to ecology for over a century, yet the ways in which disturbances
   reshape the physical structure of forest canopies remain relatively
   unknown. Moderate severity disturbances affect different canopy strata
   and plant species, resulting in variable structural outcomes and
   ecological consequences. Terrestrial lidar (light detection and ranging)
   offers an unprecedented view of the interior arrangement and
   distribution of canopy elements, permitting the derivation of
   multidimensional measures of canopy structure that describe several
   canopy structural traits (CSTs) with known links to ecosystem function.
   We used lidar-derived CSTs within a machine learning framework to detect
   and describe the structural changes that result from various disturbance
   agents, including moderate severity fire, ice storm damage, age-related
   senescence, hemlock woolly adelgid, beech bark disease, and chronic
   acidification. We found that fire and ice storms primarily affected the
   amount and position of vegetation within canopies, while acidification,
   senescence, pathogen, and insect infestation altered canopy arrangement
   and complexity. Only two of the six disturbance agents significantly
   reduced leaf area, counter to common assumptions regarding many moderate
   severity disturbances. While findings are limited in their
   generalizability due to lack of replication among disturbances, they do
   suggest that the current limitations of standard disturbance detection
   methods-such as optical-based remote sensing platforms, which are often
   above-canopy perspectives-limit our ability to understand the full
   ecological and structural impacts of disturbance, and to evaluate the
   consistency of structural patterns within and among disturbance agents.
   A more broadly inclusive definition of ecological disturbance that
   incorporates multiple aspects of canopy structural change may
   potentially improve the modeling, detection, and prediction of
   functional implications of moderate severity disturbance as well as
   broaden our understanding of the ecological impacts of disturbance.},

Title = {Identifying tropical Ecuadorian Andean trees from inter-crown pixel
   distributions in hyperspatial aerial imagery},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {548-559},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Question Identification of tropical tree species from low-cost, very
   high-resolution (VHR) proximal canopy remote sensing imagery has great
   potential for improving our understanding of tropical forest ecology. We
   investigated whether inter-crown pixel information from VHR imagery
   could be used for taxonomic identification of trees and characterization
   of successional stages of tropical Andean mountain forest. Location
   Santa Lucia cloud forest reserve, NW Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We
   gathered digital camera imagery (0.05-m spatial resolution), using a
   remote-controlled helicopter platform, from primary and secondary forest
   and identified visible crowns to species before extracting digital crown
   samples (2-m radius). Using an object-based approach, histogram
   descriptors and diversity metrics of pixel intensity in red, green and
   blue (RGB) bands were calculated for crowns, and patterns in similarity
   explored using ordination. Predictive models were developed and
   validated using four decision tree models (CHIAD, Exhaustive CHIAD, CRT
   and QUEST). Results Aerial imagery represented 54\% of families, 53\% of
   genera and 56\% of species sampled from the ground. Ordination
   (redundancy analysis) confirmed that inherent continuities, based on
   crown metrics, correlated with traditional species, genus and family
   groupings (P < 0.05). Data were best described by histogram means in the
   green band. The best predictive model (CRT) generated a 47\% probability
   of correct species identification for 41 species with similar success at
   genus and family level. Predictive ability was highly species-specific,
   ranging from zero for some taxa to 93\% for Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec.
   Conclusions From the crown metrics tested, we found the mean pixel
   intensity in the green band was most effective in predicting species and
   species grouping of tropical mountain trees. This metric integrates
   species-specific differences in leaf density of crowns and reflectance
   in the green waveband. High predictive success for indicators of primary
   (Cornus peruviana J.F. Macbr.) and secondary forest (Cecropia gabrielis
   Cuatrec.) shows that VHR imagery can be used to identify species from
   pixel information to provide ecological information on successional
   status. Further research is needed to develop pattern and textural
   metrics specifically for hyperspatial digital imagery to identify tree
   species from crown imagery in diverse tropical forests.},

Title = {Spatial modelling of biodiversity at the community level},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {393-404},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Statistical modelling is often used to relate sparse biological
   survey data to remotely derived environmental predictors, thereby
   providing a basis for predictively mapping biodiversity across an entire
   region of interest. The most popular strategy for such modelling has
   been to model distributions of individual species one at a time. Spatial
   modelling of biodiversity at the community level may, however, confer
   significant benefits for applications involving very large numbers of
   species, particularly if many of these species are recorded
   infrequently.
   2. Community-level modelling combines data from multiple species and
   produces information on spatial pattern in the distribution of
   biodiversity at a collective community level instead of, or in addition
   to, the level of individual species. Spatial outputs from
   community-level modelling include predictive mapping of community types
   (groups of locations with similar species composition), species groups
   (groups of species with similar distributions), axes or gradients of
   compositional variation, levels of compositional dissimilarity between
   pairs of locations, and various macro-ecological properties (e.g.
   species richness).
   3. Three broad modelling strategies can be used to generate these
   outputs: (i) `assemble first, predict later', in which biological survey
   data are first classified, ordinated or aggregated to produce
   community-level entities or attributes that are then modelled in
   relation to environmental predictors; (ii) `predict first, assemble
   later', in which individual species are modelled one at a time as a
   function of environmental variables, to produce a stack of species
   distribution maps that is then subjected to classification, ordination
   or aggregation; and (iii) `assemble and predict together', in which all
   species are modelled simultaneously, within a single integrated
   modelling process. These strategies each have particular strengths and
   weaknesses, depending on the intended purpose of modelling and the type,
   quality and quantity of data involved.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The potential benefits of modelling large
   multispecies data sets using community-level, as opposed to
   species-level, approaches include faster processing, increased power to
   detect shared patterns of environmental response across rarely recorded
   species, and enhanced capacity to synthesize complex data into a form
   more readily interpretable by scientists and decision-makers.
   Community-level modelling therefore deserves to be considered more
   often, and more widely, as a potential alternative or supplement to
   modelling individual species.},

Title = {Considering the fate of electronic tags: interactions with stakeholders
   and user responsibility when encountering tagged aquatic animals},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1147-1153},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. The use of electronic tagging (e.g. acoustic, archival and satellite
   telemetry) to study the behavior and ecology of aquatic animals has
   increased dramatically over the past decade. As scientists continue to
   use these tools, it is inevitable that other researchers and the public
   at-large will encounter animals carrying such tags with increasing
   frequency. If the animals appear burdened or injured by the tag (e.g.
   showing signs of trauma), or if the tag is functionally impaired (e.g.
   cracked or severely biofouled), these encounters have the potential to
   generate conflict with various wildlife stakeholders (e.g.
   tourists/operators, divers, fishers, hunters) that can negatively affect
   research efforts and undermine conservation work. Yet, these encounters
   also present an unparalleled opportunity to advance the field of
   biotelemetry by improving animal welfare, tagging technology and
   practices, while also gaining the trust and support of wildlife
   stakeholders. Therefore, as scientists, it is important to consider the
   fate of our electronic tags. Here we consider tagged animals as
   encountered by different user groups and discuss the potential steps and
   recommendations that scientists can take to improve tagging techniques
   and animal welfare as a result. We also discuss interactions with
   stakeholders and the manifold benefits if such interactions are taken
   into account and embraced. We examine the situation where a researcher
   encounters, and is able and trained to handle a previously tagged animal
   equipped with a functionally impaired tag and/or the animal is
   exhibiting signs of burden due to the tag. We generate a decision tree
   for scientists faced with such a scenario and discuss the best course of
   action, whereas such a situation was relatively unlikely in the past,
   but is now a reality in all aquatic animal tagging studies. The
   framework in which these issues are discussed is novel and failure to
   address them can significantly impede advances in the development and
   use of biotelemetry and even one's ability to conduct research. It is
   our hope that our essay stimulates further discourse, debate,
   technological improvements and consideration of the fate of electronic
   tagging.},

Title = {Exploring succession within aspen communities using a habitat-based
   modeling approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {288},
Pages = {203-212},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forest communities play a
   crucial ecological role across western North America. However, there is
   increasing evidence that these communities have diverging ecological
   roles across aspen's expansive range. Previous studies show evidence for
   both ``seral{''} and ``stable{''} aspen functional types. This leads us
   to believe that the pathway of these systems may not always lead to a
   climax conifer sere, but in many cases results in a stable community
   dominated by aspen. This study is an attempt to use a static model,
   based on large-scale environmental variables, to account for
   successional dynamics within aspen-conifer systems and predict
   distributions of aspen functional types across large landscapes.
   Environmental factors influencing aspen-conifer succession have been
   observed in past research but not fully explored. Our study
   methodologies and application of model results were specifically
   designed to aid land managers in identifying extent and function of
   aspen forest communities in order to plan restoration projects. Four
   study sites were chosen within Utah in order to capture the widest
   geographic variance. Photointerpretation of National Agriculture Imagery
   Program (NAIP) color infrared imagery was used to classify dominant
   forest cover at approximately 250 plots within each site. At each plot,
   variables were calculated and derived from DAYMET data, digital
   elevation models, and soil surveys and assessed for precision and
   ability to model forest type distributions. A generalized linear model
   was used to assess habitat overlap between aspen and conifer in order to
   explore successional dynamics and predict areas where stable aspen
   communities are likely to occur. Model results indicate an interaction
   between topographic position and moisture influence the probability of
   conifer encroachment but do not preclude conifers entirely. The highest
   probability for stable aspen communities occurs between 60 and 90 cm of
   total annual precipitation on topographic positions receiving greater
   than 4500W h/m(2)/d of solar radiation. Prediction-conditioned
   fallout-rates were used to partition the continuous model output into a
   ``hard{''} classification. These results were applied in an overlay
   analysis with Southwest Regional Gap landcover data, indicating 19\% of
   aspen forests across Utah are potentially stable functional types,
   whereas the remaining 81\% are vulnerable to conifer encroachment. (C)

Title = {Resilience in social-ecological systems: identifying stable and unstable
   equilibria with agent-based models},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To determine the resilience of complex social-ecological systems (SESs)
   it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the system behavior
   under changing political, economic, and environmental conditions (i.e.,
   external system stressors). Such behavior can be predicted if one knows
   the stable and unstable equilibrium states in a system and how these
   equilibria react to changes in the system stressors. The state of the
   system rapidly or gradually changes either toward (i.e., stable
   equilibrium) or away from (i.e., unstable equilibrium) an equilibrium.
   However, the equilibrium states in a SES are often unknown and difficult
   to identify in real systems. In contrast, agent-based SES models can
   potentially be used to determine equilibria states, but are rarely used
   for this purpose. We developed a generic approach to identify stable and
   unstable equilibria states with agent-based SES models. We used an
   agent-based SES model to simulate land-use change in an alpine mountain
   region in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. By iteratively running this
   model for different input settings, we were able to identify equilibria
   in intensive and extensive agriculture. We also assessed the sensitivity
   of these equilibria to changes in external system stressors. With
   support-vector machine classifications, we created bifurcation diagrams
   in which the stable and unstable equilibria as a function of the values
   of a system stressor were depicted. The external stressors had a strong
   influence on the equilibrium states. We also found that a minimum amount
   of direct payments was necessary for agricultural extensification to
   take place. Our approach does not only provide valuable insights into
   the resilience of our case-study region to changing conditions, but can
   also be applied to other (agent-based) SES models to present important
   model results in a condensed and understandable format.},

Title = {Influence of environmental variables on macroinvertebrate community
   structure in Lianhuan Lake},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The structural characteristics of the macroinvertebrate community can
   effectively reflect the health status of lake ecosystems and the quality
   of the lake ecological environment. It is therefore important to
   identify the limiting factors of macroinvertebrate community structure
   for the maintenance of lake ecosystem health. In this study, the
   community composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages and their
   relationships with environmental variables were investigated in 13 small
   lakes within Lianhuan Lake in northern China. A self-organizing map and
   K-means clustering analysis grouped the macroinvertebrate communities
   into five groups, and the indicator species reflected the environmental
   characteristics of each group. Principal component analysis indicated
   that the classification of the macroinvertebrate communities was
   affected by environmental variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test results
   showed that environmental variables (pH, total phosphorus, nitrate,
   water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, permanganate index,
   and ammonium) had a significant effect on the classification of the
   macroinvertebrate communities. Redundancy analysis showed that mollusks
   were significantly negatively correlated with pH and chlorophyll a,
   while annelids and aquatic insects were significantly positively
   correlated with chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen. Spearman correlation
   analysis showed that the species richness and Shannon's diversity of
   macroinvertebrates were significantly negatively correlated with total
   phosphorus, while the biomass of macroinvertebrates was significantly
   negatively correlated with pH. High alkalinity and lake eutrophication
   have a serious impact on the macroinvertebrate community. Human
   disturbances, such as industrial and agricultural runoff, negatively
   impact the ecological environment and affect macroinvertebrate community
   structure. Thus, macroinvertebrate community structure should be
   improved by enhancing the ecological environment and controlling
   environmental pollution at a watershed scale.},

Title = {A comparative study of hard clustering algorithms for vegetation data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Questions Which clustering algorithms are most effective according to
   different cluster validity evaluators? Which distance or dissimilarity
   measure is most suitable for clustering algorithms? Location Hyrcanian
   forest, Iran (Asia), Virginia region forest, United States (North
   America), beech forests, Ukraine (Europe). Methods We tested 25
   clustering algorithms with nine vegetation data sets comprised of three
   real data sets and six simulated data sets exhibiting different cluster
   separation values. The clustering algorithms included both hierarchical
   and non-hierarchical partitioning. Five evaluators were employed on each
   cluster solution to evaluate different clustering algorithms. Algorithms
   were ranked from best to worst on each clustering evaluator for each
   data set. Results The comparison revealed that the OPTSIL initiated from
   a Flexible-beta (-0.25) solution achieved particularly good performance.
   We also found that Ward's method and Flexible-beta (-0.1)
   implementations were accurate. K-means with Hellinger distance was
   superior to Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithms. Accordance
   between distance measures and clustering algorithms was also observed.
   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity combined with a range of clustering algorithms
   was successful in most cases. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity proved superior
   to other distance measures for heterogeneous data sets. Conclusions All
   in all, the results demonstrate that choosing the most suitable method
   before clustering is critical for achieving maximally interpretable
   clusters. The complexity of vegetation data sets makes this issue even
   more important. The choice of distance measure had more effect than the
   choice of clustering method on the quality of results. Our results
   illustrate that OPTSIL Flexible-beta (-0.1) and OPTPART could prove
   superior to alternative conventional clustering algorithms when internal
   evaluation criteria are used to optimize clustering.},

Title = {Loss of intermediate-flow states only evident when considering sub-daily
   flow metrics in a major tributary of the Limpopo basin},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As the impacts of the anthropocene intensifies, there is an increasing
   need to understand how these changes affect both daily and sub-daily
   stream flow variability, timing and flow quantities, as these are some
   of the most influential drivers of spatial and temporal dynamics of
   stream biota. In this paper, long-term changes in flow patterns of a
   strategic water source area (Luvuvhu catchment) in an arid region of
   southern Africa were quantified, focusing on the relation between daily
   and sub-daily flow and its potential impact on fish biota of the
   catchment. Long-term temporal trends in stream flow were modelled using
   generalized least squares (GLS), while sub-daily and daily mean flow of
   the same stations were compared using a suite of metrics. Periods of
   similar stream flow patterns were identified using K-means cluster
   analysis. A spreadsheet rule-based model was developed linking fish
   communities to streamflow patterns, providing a predictive framework for
   fish assemblage responses to stream flow classes. Long-term reduction in
   flow in the Luvuvhu catchment has a strong seasonal component, with
   significant decreases during the wet season, not linked to long-term
   rainfall patterns. The flow regime of the Luvuvhu river system has
   become more variable over time. Several sub-daily flow metrics were
   positively related to daily flow metrics. Oscillating flow conditions
   and the loss of intermediate-flow states may permanently exclude certain
   fish flow guilds. However, temporal partitioning is only evident when
   sub-daily metrics are considered, highlighting their importance for
   assessing ecological resilience.},

Abstract = {QuestionsWhat is the community diversity of tall, humid herb grasslands
   in Western Mediterranean Europe? What are the diagnostic species of the
   Molinio-Holoschoenion alliance? What underlying ecological patterns
   influence their diversity?
   LocationWestern Mediterranean Europe (France, Portugal and Spain).
   MethodsWe compiled a vegetation plot database of Molinio-Holoschoenion
   plant communities. The initial data set of 1056 plots was filtered
   according to physiognomic and floristic criteria, and geographically
   stratified. We used hierarchical agglomerative classification and
   semi-supervised classification techniques based on the k-means algorithm
   as a combination of methods to define vegetation types. A DCA analysis
   was performed to assess the main ecological drivers of diversity in the
   Molinio-Holoschoenion community.
   ResultsSeventeen vegetation types were defined, which can be classified
   in the following major vegetation groups: (1) tall humid grasslands on
   base-poor and sandy soils; (2) Scirpoides holoschoenus grasslands on
   base-rich soils; and (3) eastern Iberian and southwestern French
   Schoenus nigricans and/or Molinia caerulea grasslands. The water-logging
   gradient was recognized as a major underlying pattern influencing the
   diversity and distribution of Molinio-Holoschoenion, and at a second
   level, the soil factor.
   ConclusionsWe suggest a revision of the concept of the
   Molinio-Holoschoenion alliance to be considered for the interpretation
   of habitat type 6420 of the European Habitats Directive, which should
   include Mediterranean wet dune slacks and tall, humid inland grasslands.
   This vegetation type is largely distributed on the eastern Iberian
   Peninsula, where base-rich soils are predominant and Scirpoides
   holoschoenus grasslands comprise the main floristic composition of the
   alliance.},

Abstract = {Plant species composition is a critical issue in ecological research.
   Studies on the characteristics of plant species composition in the
   built-up areas, however, are hampered by a lack of basic field-based
   investigation. In this article, the plant species composition in the
   built-up areas of Beijing, China, is investigated using abundant field
   observations. The origin of species, chorological spectra, life forms
   and plant communities were determined. The characteristic species in
   each type of green space were determined by k-means classification, and
   urban plant communities were identified by two-way indicator species
   analysis (TWINSPAN). Plant species composition in the built-up areas was
   further compared with that in natural mountain floras in Beijing to
   reveal the differences in life form composition and chorological
   spectra, and the coincidence of species in the two communities. A total
   of 618 plant species belonging to 349 genera and 103 families were
   identified. Our results revealed wide chorological spectra with trees
   dominated by deciduous species. Although native plant species were
   widely distributed, 53\% of the plant species were aliens, among which
   67\% were introduced from America and other Asian countries.
   Furthermore, the characteristics of the plant species composition in the
   built-up areas are significantly different from those of the natural
   habitats. Our results highlight the dramatic changes in characteristics
   of plant species composition in the built-up area of Beijing. Several
   suggestions are proposed to increase the diversity of native species
   through the planning and management of green spaces.},

Title = {Acknowledging differences: number, characteristics, and distribution of
   marine benthic communities along Taiwan coast},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Our knowledge of the ability of coral reefs to face contemporary
   challenges disregards the wide variety of benthic communities (BCs) that
   could be associated with contrasted dynamics when facing stressors.
   Accordingly, this study investigates the number, characteristics, and
   distribution of BCs responsible for the development of coastal
   three-dimensional structures in Taiwan. A total of 89 transects among
   three regions (north, east, and south) and two depths (-10 and -40 m)
   were characterized using a morpho-functional categorization of benthic
   organisms. Using an unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means cluster, an
   optimal number of k groups were identified among transects in order to
   minimize total intra-group variance and represent a first level of
   organization, mirroring the number of BCs. Each BC was then described
   into prevailing categories and typified by an association with
   significant indicator groups. Their distributions were further examined
   and tested among regions and depths. Seven BCs were identified as having
   different composition and indicator categories. Their distributions
   suggest that, while sea surface temperature and light regime may be
   associated with a panel of available BCs, local conditions may have the
   final say on whether a BC eventually thrives at a given location.
   Overall, this study proposes an innovative and simple analytical
   framework for acknowledging differences among BCs. Our results encourage
   greater consideration of these shades in coral reef ecology studies, as
   they could conceal a variety of roles and dynamics important for the
   conservation of these endangered ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Aim Develop a biogeographical classification of phytoplankton size
   distributions for the Atlantic Ocean and predict the global
   phytoplankton size composition based on prevailing environmental
   conditions.
   Location Atlantic Ocean and Global Ocean
   Methods Using phytoplankton size composition data, nutrient
   concentrations (nitrite+nitrate, phosphate, and silicate), irradiance,
   temperature and zooplankton abundances of the Atlantic Meridional
   Transect programme, we derived and tested an environmental
   classification method of phytoplankton size distribution with a k-means
   clustering technique. We then used principal component and Dirichlet
   multivariate regression analyses to disentangle the relative influence
   of different environmental conditions on the phytoplankton size
   composition. Subsequently, we evaluated different probabilisitic models
   and selected the most parsimonious one to estimate the global
   phytoplankton size distributions in the world oceans based on global
   climatology data of the World Ocean Atlas 2009.
   Results Based only on prevailing environmental conditions and without a
   priori knowledge concerning, for example, the position of oceanic
   fronts, the primary productivity, the distribution of organisms or any
   geographical information, our classification method captures the size
   structures of phytoplankton communities across the Atlantic. We find a
   strong influence of temperature and nitrite+nitrate concentration on the
   prevalence of the different size classes, and we present evidence that
   both factors may act independently on structuring phytoplankton
   communities. While at low nitrite+nitrate concentrations temperature has
   a major structuring impact, at high nitrite+nitrate concentrations its
   influence is reduced. Finally, we show that the global distribution of
   phytoplankton community size structure can be predicted by a
   probabilistic model based only on temperature and nitrite+nitrate.
   Main conclusion The global distribution of phytoplankton community size
   structure can be predicted with good approximation using a parsimonious
   probabilistic model forced by only temperature and nitrite+nitrate data.},

Title = {Considerations for ecological reconstruction of historic vegetation:
   Analysis of the spatial uncertainties in the California Vegetation Type
   Map dataset},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {194},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-49},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Historical ecological data are valuable for reconstructing early
   environmental and vegetation community conditions and examining change
   to vegetation communities and disturbance regimes over decadal and
   longer temporal scales, but these data are not free from error. We
   examine the spatial uncertainties associated with 18,000 vegetation
   plots in the decades-old California Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM)
   dataset that has been digitized for use in modern ecological analysis.
   We examine the relationship between plot location error and basemap
   year, basemap scale, plot elevation, plot slope, and general plot
   habitat type. Bivariate plots and classification and regression tree
   analysis (CART) confirm that basemap scale and age are the strongest
   explanation of total error. Total error in spatial location for all
   plots ranged from 126.9 m to 462.3 m; plots drawn on 15-min
   (1:62,500-scale) basemaps had total error ranging from 126 m to 199.7 m,
   and plots drawn on coarser-scale basemaps (1:125,000-scale) had total
   errors ranging from 241 m to 461.2 m. Relocation of individual VTM plots
   is considerably easier for plots originally marked on 1:62,500-scale
   maps produced after 1904, and more difficult for plots originally marked
   on 1:125,000-scale maps produced before 1898. Biogeographical analyses
   that rely less on relocating individual plots, such as environmental
   niche modeling or multivariate analyses can alleviate some of these
   concerns, but all researchers using these kinds of data need to consider
   errors in spatial location of plots. The paper also discusses ways in
   which the differing spatial error might be reported and visualized by
   those using the dataset, and how the data might be used in modern
   environmental niche models.},

Title = {Exploring the relationship between key ecosystem services and
   socioecological drivers in alpine basins: A case of Issyk-Kul Basin in
   Central Asia},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Natural changes and human disturbance have far-reaching influences on
   ecosystem services (ESs) in arid alpine basins. In this paper, the
   Issyk-Kul Basin (IKB) is taken as a case study to systematically
   quantify 5 ES distributions and determine ES hotspots/coldspots. We used
   Spearman correlation analysis to explore trade-offs and synergies
   between ESs. Then, ES bundles and socioecological drivers of ESs were
   identified by utilizing K-means clustering and redundancy analysis
   (RDA). The results revealed that the water yield (WY) and soil retention
   (SR) in the IKB increased significantly from 1992 to 2015, but food
   production (FP) and habitat quality (HQ) exhibited decreasing trends.
   Correlation analysis indicated a synergistic relationship between SR and
   WY/NPP (R = 0.34/R = 0.68; p < 0.001), and a trade-off relationship
   between FP and HQ (r = -0.35; p < 0.01). Based on cluster analysis,
   three ES bundles were identified, including the ``Agriculture
   bundle{''}, ``Soil \& vegetation bundle{''} and ``Habit quality
   bundle{''}. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that WY and SR were
   mainly affected by natural factors (i.e., precipitation, slope and
   vegetation coverage), while FP and HQ were more sensitive to human
   factors (i. e., population density, percentage of cropland and
   percentage of urban). Our findings promote a better understanding of the
   complex relationship between ESs, and provide a reference for developing
   win-win management strategies for socioeconomic development and
   ecological protection in alpine basins.},

Title = {Spectral changing during a massive bloom event of Dinophysis cf.
   accuminata in south Brazil},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are deleterious ecological phenomena that
   can severely impact coastal ecosystems, fisheries resources, and public
   health worldwide. Different HABs species have distinct spectral
   characteristics due to the specific absorption of their accessory
   pigments, allowing us to monitor them through remote sensing. In June
   2016, a massive Dinophysis cf. acuminata bloom hit the southern
   Brazilian coast causing damage to the local mariculture along its
   trajectory. In order to observe its passage and evolution, we performed
   weekly sampling cruises in the coastal waters of Parana, Brazil. Remote
   sensing reflectance (Rrs) data were performed with FieldSpec ASD, along
   with oceanographic variables (water temperature, salinity, Secchi
   depths, chlorophyll fluorescence, and particulate matter concentration).
   Satellite images from MODIS and OLI were used to quantify the magnitude
   of the HAB. During its peak, the bloom reached an area of 201 km2 along
   the Parana coast with abundances of 6.85 x 106 cells.L-1, the highest
   cell density ever recorded for this species. The event was associated
   with low salinity and temperature from a high chlorophyll plume from the
   La Plata River. The in situ Rrs were grouped by hierarchical clustering,
   separating the spectral signature of the Dinophysis bloom through
   principal component analysis. The same spectral shape was observed in
   the K-means clustering of both MODIS and OLI images, attesting to the
   method's suitability. We address the first characterization of a
   Dinophysis bloom, and the results can contribute to a better
   understanding of the spectral response of this toxic dinoflagellate and
   optimize the satellite algorithms for the detection of HABs.(c) 2022

Title = {Have old species reached most environmentally suitable areas? A case
   study with South American phyllostomid bats},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {AimWe used ecological niche modelling to test different models
   explaining the lineage age-area relationship. We hypothesized that
   lineage age should influence the proportion of potential range unfilled
   by phyllostomid bat species. We made explicit predictions about possible
   relationships between the proportion of unfilled potential range and
   lineage age. Our goal was to analyse empirical data and fit the model
   that best describes our data.
   LocationSouth America.
   MethodsWe modelled the ecological niche of 49 phyllostomid bat species
   using Maxent and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We calculated the
   proportion of unfilled potential range as the amount of area outside the
   current distribution divided by the current distribution (realized range
   size). Using a dated phylogeny, we regressed the proportion of unfilled
   potential range on lineage age. To compare our predictions we also
   regressed realized range size on lineage age.
   ResultsUnfilled potential range was weakly associated with lineage age.
   This relationship was an inverse function of lineage age, explaining
   between 0 and 17\% of the proportion of unfilled potential range.
   Furthermore, the relationship between realized range size and lineage
   age exhibited a logarithmic function, with lineage age explaining
   between 13 and 20\% of the variation in realized range size.
   Main conclusionsDifferent regression models indicated that old
   phyllostomid species have smaller unfilled ranges than young species.
   That is, old species have filled most of the areas that are suitable for
   them. Furthermore, old species have larger realized ranges than young
   species. We thus refuted both the lineage age-area and taxon cycle
   models and lent support to the stasis post-expansion model. This
   suggests that bat species can reach most of their potential range
   rapidly after cladogenesis and such occupation remains more or less
   constant through time.},

Title = {Scaling functions evaluation for estimation of landscape metrics at
   higher resolutions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the relationship between landscape pattern and
   environmental processes requires quantification of landscape pattern at
   multiple scales. This will make it possible to relate broad-scale
   patterns to fine-scale processes and vice versa. In this study, we used
   class level landscape metrics calculated at multiple scales to fit
   scaling functions that were used to downscale metrics at higher
   resolutions. The main objectives were to assess the performance of
   different type of functions (i.e. power, logarithmic, etc.) to downscale
   metrics at the subpixel level and to analyze the variability of the
   accuracy of subpixel estimates among patch classes for each landscape
   metric We used thirteen frequently used landscape metrics, computed on a
   land use/land cover map derived from Landsat imagery through visual
   interpretation and supervised classification using Support Vector
   Machines. The performance of scaling functions was assessed with the
   Accuracy Improvement percentage (AI). In general, the power function
   fitted better for most landscape metrics and classes; however, in
   several cases, more than one type of function showed similar R-2 values.
   Accuracy of subpixel estimates was very variable among landscape metrics
   and also among patch classes within a metric The amount of variation was
   such that no generalization about the predictability of a landscape
   metric calculated at the class level was possible. Indeed,
   predictability seemed to be more of a characteristic of the class than a
   characteristic of the landscape metric. Additionally, the goodness of
   fit of the scaling functions was not a good indicator of the functions'
   ability to downscale landscape metrics accurately, indicating that
   different scaling functions should be analyzed when downscaling
   landscape metrics at higher resolutions is required. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Landscape transition drives environmental change across the globe.
   However, landscape and its change are complex with high spatial
   heterogeneity, which challenges strategic decision-making.
   This paper aims to derive management meaningful units based on landscape
   status and change analysis and the generalization of landscape spatial
   heterogeneity.
   Based on contrasting cases from Finland (Vanajavesi) and China (Baota
   District), this paper analyzed the landscape attributes and change since
   2000. A k-means clustering approach was used to generalize the landscape
   types based on indicators of landscape composition and its change,
   spatial pattern, population, and income.
   Most significant change in land covers was the expansion of artificial
   surfaces, and the bi-directional transitions between agricultural areas
   and forests and semi-natural areas in Vanajavesi, while the expansion of
   artificial land and shrinkage of cropland were most significant in Baota
   District. Larger changes in landscape metrics were also observed in
   Baota District. Finally, three landscape clusters were generalized in
   both of the case areas. For each cluster, the landscapes and their
   change characteristics were interpreted as pertinent to the average land
   cover pattern and its change and socioeconomic conditions. Brief
   landscape management recommendations were also given for the resulting
   clusters.
   This paper contributes to enriching the understanding of the analysis
   and management of landscape spatial heterogeneity based on the
   information from both landscape status and change. The contrasting case
   analyses from an international perspective indicate the usefulness of
   clustering approach in accommodating spatial heterogeneity, which imply
   a regionalized need for landscape monitoring, assessment, and
   management.},

Abstract = {Long-term fire exclusion has altered ecological function in many
   forested ecosystems in North America. The invasion of fire-sensitive
   tree species into formerly pyrogenic upland forests in the southeastern
   United States has resulted in dramatic shifts in surface fuels that have
   been hypothesized to cause reductions in plant community flammability.
   The mechanism for the reduced flammability or mesophication has lacked
   empirical study. Here we evaluate a potential mechanism of reduced
   flammability by quantifying moisture retention (response time and
   initial moisture capacity) of foliar litter beds from 17 southeastern
   tree species spanning a wide range of fire tolerance. A k-means cluster
   analysis resulted in four species groups: a rapidly drying cluster of
   eight species; a five-species group that absorbed little water but
   desorbed slowly; a two-species group that absorbed substantial moisture
   but desorbed rapidly; and a two-species cluster that absorbed
   substantial moisture and dried slowly. Fire-sensitive species were
   segregated into the slow moisture loss clusters while fire-tolerant
   species tended to cluster in the rapid drying groups.
   Principal-components analysis indicated that several leaf
   characteristics correlated with absorption capacity and drying rates.
   Thin-leaved species with high surface area:volume absorbed the greatest
   moisture content, while those with large, curling leaves had the fastest
   drying rates. The dramatic shifts in litter fuels as a result of
   invasion by fire-sensitive species generate a positive feedback that
   reduce the windows of ignition, thereby facilitating the survival,
   persistence, and continued invasion of fire-sensitive species in the
   uplands of the southeastern United States.},

Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are a common approach to describing
   species' space-use and spatially-explicit abundance. With a myriad of
   model types, methods and parameterization options available, it is
   challenging to make informed decisions about how to build robust SDMs
   appropriate for a given purpose. One key component of SDM development is
   the appropriate parameterization of covariates, such as the inclusion of
   covariates that reflect underlying processes (e.g. abiotic and biotic
   covariates) and covariates that act as proxies for unobserved processes
   (e.g. space and time covariates). It is unclear how different SDMs
   apportion variance among a suite of covariates, and how parameterization
   decisions influence model accuracy and performance. To examine
   trade-offs in covariation parameterization in SDMs, we explore the
   attribution of spatiotemporal and environmental variation across a suite
   of SDMs. We first used simulated species distributions with known
   environmental preferences to compare three types of SDM: a machine
   learning model (boosted regression tree), a semi-parametric model
   (generalized additive model) and a spatiotemporal mixed-effects model
   (vector autoregressive spatiotemporal model, VAST). We then applied the
   same comparative framework to a case study with three fish species
   (arrowtooth flounder, pacific cod and walleye pollock) in the eastern
   Bering Sea, USA. Model type and covariate parameterization both had
   significant effects on model accuracy and performance. We found that
   including either spatiotemporal or environmental covariates typically
   reproduced patterns of species distribution and abundance across the
   three models tested, but model accuracy and performance was maximized
   when including both spatiotemporal and environmental covariates in the
   same model framework. Our results reveal trade-offs in the current
   generation of SDM tools between accurately estimating species abundance,
   accurately estimating spatial patterns, and accurately quantifying
   underlying species-environment relationships. These comparisons between
   model types and parameterization options can help SDM users better
   understand sources of model bias and estimate error.},

   frequently assumed but rarely tested that models of habitat suitability
   ('species distribution models', SDMs) may provide useful indices of
   habitat quality, either from an individual animal or manager's
   perspective. Critically, SDMs are increasingly used to estimate species'
   ranges, with an implicit assumption that areas of high suitability will
   result in higher probability of persistence. This assumption underlies
   efforts to use SDMs to design protected areas, assess the status of
   cryptic species or manage responses to climate change. Recent tests of
   this relationship have provided mixed results, suggesting SDMs may
   predict abundance but not other measures of high-quality habitat (e. g.
   survival, persistence).
   2. In this study, we created a suite of SDMs for the endangered giant
   kangaroo rat Dipodomys ingens at three distinct scales using the
   machine-learning method Maxent. We compared these models with three
   measures of habitat quality: survival, abundance and body condition.
   3. Species distribution models were not correlated with survival, while
   models at all scales were positively correlated with abundance.
   Finer-scale models were more closely correlated with abundance than the
   largest scale. Body condition was not correlated with habitat
   suitability at any scale. The inability of models to predict survival
   may be due to a lack of information in environmental covariates;
   unmeasured community processes or stochastic events; or the inadequacy
   of using models that predict species presence to also predict
   demography.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Species distribution models (SDMs),
   especially fine scale ones, may be useful for longer-term management
   goals, such as identifying high-quality habitat for protection. However,
   short-term management decisions should be based only on models that use
   covariates appropriate for the necessary temporal and spatial scales.
   Assumptions about the relationship between habitat suitability and
   habitat quality must be made explicit. Even then, care should be taken
   in inferring multiple types of habitat quality from SDMs.},

Abstract = {Questions Can forest site characteristics be used to predict Ellenberg
   indicator values for soil moisture? Which is the best averaged mean
   value for modelling? Does the distribution of soil moisture depend on
   spatial information? Location Bavarian Alps, Germany. Methods We used
   topographic, climatic and edaphic variables to model the mean soil
   moisture value as found on 1505 forest plots from the database
   WINALPecobase. All predictor variables were taken from area-wide geodata
   layers so that the model can be applied to some 250 000 ha of forest in
   the target region. We adopted methods developed in species distribution
   modelling to regionalize Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, we use
   the additive georegression framework for spatial prediction of Ellenberg
   values with the R-library mboost, which is a feasible way to consider
   environmental effects, spatial autocorrelation, predictor interactions
   and non-stationarity simultaneously in our data. The framework is much
   more flexible than established statistical and machine-learning models
   in species distribution modelling. We estimated five different mboost
   models reflecting different model structures on 50 bootstrap samples in
   each case. Results Median R2 values calculated on independent test
   samples ranged from 0.28 to 0.45. Our results show a significant
   influence of interactions and non-stationarity in addition to
   environmental covariates. Unweighted mean indicator values can be
   modelled better than abundance-weighted values, and the consideration of
   bryophytes did not improve model performance. Partial response curves
   indicate meaningful dependencies between moisture indicator values and
   environmental covariates. However, mean indicator values <4.5 and >6.0
   could not be modelled correctly, since they were poorly represented in
   our calibration sample. The final map represents high-resolution
   information of site hydrological conditions. Conclusions Indicator
   values offer an effect-oriented alternative to physically-based
   hydrological models to predict water-related site conditions, even at
   landscape scale. The presented approach is applicable to all kinds of
   Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, it is a significant step towards
   a new generation of models of forest site types and potential natural
   vegetation.},

Title = {Environmental correlates of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity in the

Abstract = {Aim There is little consensus on which environmental variables are best
   at predicting multiple dimensions of diversity. We ask whether there are
   common environmental correlates of diversity, despite ecological
   differences, across nine clades of plants and animals distributed along
   a single rainforest domain. For that, we compare the environmental
   correlates of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic
   endemism.
   Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
   Taxon:Five clades of plants (Bromelioideae, Miconieae, Bertolonia,
   Cambessedesieae, and the Fridericia and allies) and four clades of
   animals (butterlies in the tribe Ithomiini, frogs in the genera Boana
   and Proceratophrys, and birds in the subfamily Thraupinae).
   Methods Using curated occurrence localities and phylogenetic data, we
   generated maps of (a) species richness, (b) phylogenetic diversity, (c)
   residuals of phylogenetic diversity regressed on species richness, and
   (d) phylogenetic endemism for all groups. We also compiled a set of 30
   environmental descriptors, including records of current temperature and
   precipitation, climatic stability over time, and topography. Through a
   machine learning framework, we explored the environmental correlates of
   each of these diversity measures for each group.
   Results The environmental variables used here were strong predictors of
   diversity for all studied groups. However, models for phylogenetic
   endemism had lower predictive power. Although patterns of diversity are
   different among groups, correlates of diversity are consistent across
   taxa. For both species richness and phylogenetic diversity, current
   precipitation and precipitation stability over time were consistently
   ranked among the variables that strongly correlate with diversity
   patterns. The correlates of phylogenetic endemism were less homogeneous
   across groups. The results suggest that including climate stability over
   time is important when predicting diversity measures that reflect
   historical components.
   Main conclusions Investigating environmental correlates of diversity for
   multiple clades and diversity measures in a single geographic area
   allows for a better understanding of common patterns across taxa. This
   study shows that environmental conditions, particularly precipitation,
   are good predictors of the patterns of species richness and phylogenetic
   diversity-but not phylogenetic endemism-across different Atlantic Forest
   groups.},

Title = {MIAT: Modular R-wrappers for flexible implementation of MaxEnt
   distribution modelling},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {215-221},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method has gained widespread use for
   distribution modelling, mostly because of the practical simplicity
   offered by the maxent.jar software. Whilst MaxEnt was originally
   described as a machine learning method, recent studies have shown that
   the method can be explained in terms of maximum likelihood estimation.
   This opens for using MaxEnt with new settings and options, such as new
   model selection and model assessment criteria, and improved user control
   of the variable selection process. New practical tools are needed to
   explore the new opportunities and assess if they enhance model
   performance and ecological interpretability of the models. We present a
   new conceptual framework, the Modular and functionally Integrated
   component-based Approach (MIA) framework for practical distribution
   modelling by which the core components of the DM process are decoupled
   and then wrapped together more flexibly into component-based functional
   modules. Computational object-oriented and workflow approaches are
   integrated with ecological, statistical and modelling theory in order to
   handle the complexity associated with the full modelling process in a
   practical way. Objects (variables, functions, results, etc.) are defined
   according to specific modelling parameters. Properties (e.g., identities
   and content) are inherited between objects and new objects are created
   in a flexible and automated, yet traceable way. We operationalise this
   framework for MaxEnt by the MIA Toolbox (MIAT), a set of flexible,
   modular R-scripts (available in supplementary appendices) wrapped around
   maxent.jar and existing R-functions. MIAT covers the full range of
   options and settings for the maximum likelihood implementation of MaxEnt
   and provide flexible guidance of users through the DM process. A trail
   of models of increasing complexity is built to enhance traceability and
   interpretability, and to suit different modelling purposes. We briefly
   outline research questions that can be addressed by the MIAT. (C) 2015

Title = {Snow cover dynamics: an overlooked yet important feature of winter bird
   occurrence and abundance across the United States},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Snow cover dynamics (i.e. depth, duration and variability) are dominant
   drivers of ecological processes during winter. For overwintering
   species, changes and gradients in snow cover may impact survival and
   population dynamics (e.g. facilitating survival via thermal refugia or
   limiting survival via reduced resource acquisition). However, snow cover
   dynamics are rarely used in species distribution modelling, especially
   for overwintering birds. Currently, we lack understanding of how snow
   cover gradients affect overwintering bird distributions and which
   functional traits drive these associations at regional and continental
   scales. Using observations from eBird, a global community science
   network, we explored the effects of snow cover dynamics on continental
   patterns of occurrence and counts for 150 bird species. We quantified
   the relative importance, species-specific responses and trait-based
   relationships of bird occurrence and abundance patterns to ecologically
   relevant snow cover dynamics across the United States. Snow cover
   dynamics were important environmental predictors in species
   distributions models, ranking within the top three predictors for most
   species occurrence (> 90\%) and count (> 79\%) patterns across the
   contiguous United States. Species exhibited a gradient of responses to
   snow cover from snow association to snow avoidance, yet most birds were
   limited by long, persistent snow seasons. Duration of winter and percent
   frozen ground without snow structured species distributions in the
   eastern USA, whereas snow cover variability was a stronger driver in the
   western USA. Birds associated with long, persistent snow seasons had
   traits associated with greater dispersal capacity and dietary diversity,
   whereas birds inhabiting regions with variable snow cover were generally
   habitat generalists. Our results suggest that various snow cover
   dynamics are important ecological filters of species distributions
   during winter. Global climate change is rapidly degrading key
   characteristics of seasonal snow cover. A changing cryosphere may elicit
   variable distributional changes for many overwintering birds,
   potentially accelerating range shifts and novel community assemblages.},

Abstract = {Fires are among the main drivers of forest degradation in Amazonia,
   causing multiple socioeconomic and environmental damages. Although
   human-ignited sources account for most of the fire events in Amazonia,
   extended droughts may magnify their occurrence and propagation. The
   southwestern Amazonia, a transnational region shared by Brazil, Peru,
   and Bolivia and known as the MAP region, has been articulating
   coordinated actions to prevent disasters, including fire, to reduce
   their negative impacts. Therefore, to understand the fire patterns in
   the MAP region, we investigated their main drivers and the changes in
   the suitability of fire occurrence for the years 2005, 2010, 2016, and
   2020. We used a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model approach based on active
   fire data from satellites, climatic data, and land use and land cover
   mapping to spatially quantify the suitability of fire occurrence and its
   drivers. We used the year 2015 to calibrate the models. For climatic
   data and active fire count, we only considered grid cells with active
   fire count over the third quartile. All our models had a satisfactory
   performance, with values of the area under the curve (AUC) above 0.75
   and p < 0.05. Additionally, all models showed sensitivity rates higher
   than 0.8 and false positive rates below 0.25. We estimated that, on
   average, 38.5\% of the study region had suitable conditions for fire
   occurrence during the study period. Most of the fire-prone areas belong
   to Acre, representing approximately 74\% of the entire MAP region. The
   percentage of deforested areas, productive lands, forest edges, and high
   temperatures were the main drivers of fire occurrence in southwestern
   Amazonia, indicating the high vulnerability of fragmented landscapes
   extreme climatic conditions to fire occurrence. We observed that the
   modeling approach based on Maxint is useful for useful for evaluating
   the implications of climatic and anthropogenic variables on fire
   distribution. Furthermore, because the model can be easily employed to
   predict suitable and non-suitable locations for fire occurrence, it can
   to prevent potential impacts associated with large-scale wildfire in the
   future at regional levels.},

Abstract = {Aim Birds have recently undergone a major extinction event which
   apparently is ongoing. According to some estimates, humans have caused
   the extinction of up to 20\% of the entire avian species diversity since
   the latter part of the Pleistocene. Few attempts, however, were made to
   determine how many extinctions are actually known, rather than projected
   to have occurred. We aimed to quantify the known avian extinctions and
   assess the relevance of factors thought to have promoted their
   extinctions, that is, large size, flightlessness and insularity.
   Location Global. Taxon Aves. Materials and Methods We collected data on
   bird extinctions from the literature. We recorded the geographic range,
   flight ability and body size of each species. If mass data were
   unavailable, we estimated them from linear measurements using machine
   learning tools. We modelled masses of extinct birds on those of extant
   ones and estimated the effects of taxonomy, body mass, insularity and
   flight ability. Results We have identified 469 species of birds that
   humans, directly or indirectly, drove to extinction. These extinctions
   have predominantly occurred on islands. Extinct birds were often
   flightless. We estimated the body mass of 291 extinct species and found
   that overall, the median mass of extinct species was seven times larger
   than that of extant ones. Extinctions mostly occurred in families of
   large-bodied birds, whilst lineages of small birds have fared better.
   Insular birds are overall larger than mainland birds, a trend that
   becomes even more evident when the extinct forms are analyzed. However,
   within lineages, sizes are only slightly larger on islands than on
   continents. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that extinct bird
   species differed from extant birds by being larger, mostly restricted to
   islands, and often flightless. These factors made them especially
   vulnerable to human prosecution and to other anthropogenically related
   declines. Our modern understanding of birds is skewed with respect to
   the nature of avian faunas that existed before the current wave of
   human-induced extinctions changed our world forever.},

Title = {A tag is worth a thousand pictures: A framework for an empirically
   grounded typology of relational values through social media},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Environmental values depend on social-ecological interactions and, in
   turn, influence the production of the underlying biophysical ecosystems.
   Understanding the nuanced nature of the values that humans ascribe to
   the environment is thus a key frontier for environmental science and
   planning. The development of many of these values depends on
   social-ecological interactions, such as outdoor recreation, landscape
   aesthetic appreciation or educational experiences with and within nature
   that can be articulated through the framework of cultural ecosystem
   services (CES). However, the non-material and intangible nature of CES
   has challenged previous at-tempts to assess the multiple and subjective
   values that people attach to them. In particular, this study focuses on
   assessing relational values ascribed to CES, here defined as values
   resonating with core principles of justice, reciprocity, care, and
   responsibility towards humans and more-than-humans. Building on emerging
   approaches for inferring relational CES values through social media (SM)
   images, this research explores the additional po-tential of a combined
   analysis of both the visual and textual content of SM data. To do so, we
   developed an inductive, empirically grounded coding protocol as well as
   a values typology that could be iteratively tested and verified by three
   different researchers to improve the consistency and replicability of
   the assessment. As a case study, we collected images and texts shared on
   the photo-sharing platform Flickr between 2004 and 2017 that were
   geotagged within the peri-urban park of Collserola, at the outskirts of
   Barcelona, Spain. Results reveal a wide spectrum of nine CES values
   within the park boundaries that show positive and negative correlations
   among each other, providing useful information for landscape planning
   and management. Moreover, the study high-lights the need for spatial,
   temporal and demographic analysis, as well as for supervised machine
   learning techniques to further leverage SM data into contextual and just
   decision-making and planning.},

Abstract = {Global warming is pushing populations outside their range of
   physiological tolerance. According to the environmental envelope
   framework, the most vulnerable populations occur near the climatic edge
   of their species' distributions. In contrast, populations from the
   climatic center of the species range should be relatively buffered
   against climate warming. We tested this latter prediction using a
   combination of linear mixed effects and machine learning algorithms on
   an extensive, citizen-scientist generated dataset on the fruitbody
   productivity of the Burgundy (aka summer) truffle (Tuber aestivum
   Vittad.), a keystone, ectomycorrhizal tree-symbiont occurring on a wide
   range of temperate climates. T. aestivum's fruitbody productivity was
   monitored at 3-week resolution over up to 8 continuous years at 20 sites
   distributed in the climatic center of its European distribution in
   southwest Germany and Switzerland. We found that T. aestivum fruitbody
   production is more sensitive to summer drought than would be expected
   from the breadth of its species' climatic niche. The monitored
   populations occurring nearly 5 degrees C colder than the edge of their
   species' climatic distribution. However, interannual fruitbody
   productivity (truffle mass year fell by a median loss of 22\% for every
   1 degrees C increase in summer temperature over a site's 30-year mean.
   Among the most productive monitored populations, the temperature
   sensitivity was even higher, with single summer temperature anomalies of
   3 degrees C sufficient to stop fruitbody production altogether.
   Interannual truffle productivity was also related to the phenology of
   host trees, with -22g less truffle mass for each 1-day reduction in the
   length of the tree growing season. Increasing summer drought extremes
   are therefore likely to reduce fruiting among summer truffle populations
   throughout Central Europe. Our results suggest that European T. aestivum
   may be a mosaic of vulnerable populations, sensitive to climate-driven
   declines at lower thresholds than implied by its species distribution
   model.},

Title = {Assessing the environmental requirements of invaders using ensembles of
   distribution models},

Abstract = {Aim
   Understanding the environmental factors determining the establishment of
   invasive populations is a crucial issue in the study of biological
   invasions. By taking into account the uncertainty of predictions,
   ensembles of niche-based models can provide useful information.
   Therefore, we explored the use of consensus techniques to generate a
   quantitative description of the environmental conditions favouring the
   establishment of four problematic invasive decapods: Cherax destructor,
   Eriocheir sinensis, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii.
   Location
   Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods
   We collected both native and invasive distribution records from multiple
   sources. From these data, we modelled the potential distribution of the
   four decapod species using eight correlative models comprising
   regression, classification and machine learning methods. The relative
   influence of the environmental variables in single models was averaged
   to achieve a consensus contribution of the variables. Ecological
   requirements were investigated by means of consensus suitability curves,
   a spatial analysis procedure that shows the variation of consensus
   suitability along the gradients of environmental variables.
   Results
   The predictive accuracy of single models ranged from fair to very good.
   Still, the variability between predictions was high. Similarly, the
   influence of each variable in different models was also uneven.
   Consensus analysis identified the variables related to temperature as
   highly influential for all invaders. Consensus suitability curves show
   that C. destructor and Procambarus clarkii have reduced suitability in
   colder areas whereas the suitability for P. leniusculus is greatly
   reduced in warmer areas. The distance to the ocean was highly
   influential in E. sinensis models, with suitability showing an
   exponential decay as distance increased.
   Main conclusions
   We show that the information about the species-environment relationships
   obtained from niche-based models is highly dependent on the
   characteristics of the models used. In this context, we demonstrate that
   ensembles of models and consensus approaches can be used to identify
   such relationships while also allowing the assessment of the uncertainty
   of the achieved knowledge.},

Title = {Combining data from field surveys and archaeological records to predict
   the distribution of culturally important trees},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Aim Indigenous communities involved in conservation planning require
   spatial datasets depicting the distribution of culturally important
   species. However, accessing datasets on the location of these species
   can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer
   reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions
   because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from
   community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species
   distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental
   western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees
   suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem
   poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to
   indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees
   suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in
   abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial
   extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which
   encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia,
   Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using
   the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from
   field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees.
   Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the
   predictions from these species distribution models. When validating
   these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the
   archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model.
   These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected
   on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the
   historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than
   the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions
   We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in
   species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target
   species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data
   limitations and an important cultural resource.},

Abstract = {Community structure modelling studies the influence of biotic and
   abiotic factors on the abundance and composition of a given taxonomic
   group of organisms. With the advancement of measurement and sensor
   technology, the availability, precision and complexity of environmental
   data constantly increases. Nowadays, measurements of ecosystems provide
   a complete snapshot of the state of the system, including information
   about the community structure of organisms that are present in a given
   sample. These measurements include multi-species data that are typically
   analysed by constructing community models as collections of models built
   for each species separately (local models) without considering the
   possible (taxonomic) relationships among species.
   In this work, we propose to construct a single community structure model
   for all the species (global model) that is able to exploit the
   aforementioned relationships. Namely, we investigate whether inclusion
   of additional information in the form of taxonomic rank or multiple
   species helps to build better community structure models. More
   specifically, we use predictive clustering trees (a generalized form of
   decision trees) to build models for three practically relevant datasets
   from the task of community structure modelling: microarthopod community
   living in the agricultural soils of Denmark, organisms living in
   Slovenian rivers and vegetation found in the State of Victoria,
   Australia.
   On each dataset, we compare the performance of four types of community
   structure models, which correspond to four machine learning tasks:
   Single species models without taxonomic rank correspond to single-label
   classification; single species models with taxonomic rank correspond to
   hierarchical single-label classification; multi-species models without
   taxonomic rank correspond to multi-label classification; and
   multi-species models with taxonomic rank correspond to hierarchical
   multi-label classification. The results of the experimental evaluation
   reveal that by using the taxonomic rank and the multi-species aspect of
   the data, we are able to learn better community structure models. (C)

Title = {A new pattern to quantitatively evaluate the value of ecosystem services

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {IntroductionOpen-pit coal mining could disrupt the ecosystem and lead to
   the loss of service values for the ecosystem through direct occupation
   or indirect impacts on adjacent ecosystems. MethodsIn this research, we
   combined a new accounting system, gross ecosystem product (GEP), with
   spatial-temporal analyses to quantify the ecological variation and
   explore its driving factors in Pingshuo, a large-scale open-pit coal
   mining area in China. GEP is an aggregate accounting system that can
   summarize the value of provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem
   services (ES) in a single monetary metric. The spatial-temporal
   approaches used in our study were known as exploratory spatial data
   analyses and interpretable models in machine learning. Both spatial and
   non-spatial data, including remote sensing images, meteorological data,
   and official statistics, were applied in the research. ResultsThe
   results indicated the following: (i) From 1990 to 2020, the annual
   average growth rates of GEP decreased from 30.78 to 9.1\%. Furthermore,
   the classified results of GEP revealed that the regions with rich ES
   quality rapidly reduced from 51.90 to 32.18\%. (ii) Spatial correlation
   of GEP was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was
   relatively high in the mining areas. Moreover, the mining areas also
   continually presented concentrated high-density and hot spot areas of
   GEP changes. (iii) The spatial-temporal effects were notable in the
   relationship between GEP and three socioeconomic factors, i.e., the
   mining effects, human activity intensity, and gross domestic product
   (GDP). (iv) The win-win development for both the economy and ecological
   environment in Pingshuo could be realized by restricting the annual
   growth rate of mining areas to between 4.56 and 5.03\%. DiscussionThe
   accounting results and spatial-temporal analyses of GEP will contribute
   to the future regional sustainable development and ecosystem management
   in Pingshuo.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity studies rely heavily on estimates of species' distributions
   often obtained through ecological niche modelling. Numerous software
   packages exist that allow users to model ecological niches using machine
   learning and statistical methods. However, no existing package with a
   graphical user interface allows users to perform model calibration and
   selection based on convex forms such as ellipsoids, which may match
   fundamental ecological niche shapes better, incorporating tools for
   exploring, modelling, and evaluating niches and distributions that are
   intuitive for both novice and proficient users. Here we describe
   anrpackage, NicheToolBox(ntbox), that allows users to conduct all
   processing steps involved in ecological niche modelling: downloading and
   curating occurrence data, obtaining and transforming environmental data
   layers, selecting environmental variables, exploring relationships
   between geographic and environmental spaces, calibrating and selecting
   ellipsoid models, evaluating models using binomial and partial ROC
   tests, assessing extrapolation risk, and performing geographic
   information system operations via a graphical user interface. A summary
   of the entire workflow is produced for use as a stand-alone algorithm or
   as part of research reports. The method is explained in detail and
   tested via modelling the threatened feline speciesLeopardus wiedii.
   Georeferenced occurrence data for this species are queried to display
   both point occurrences and the IUCN extent of occurrence polygon (IUCN,
   2007). This information is used to illustrate tools available for
   accessing, processing and exploring biodiversity data (e.g. number of
   occurrences and chronology of collecting) and transforming environmental
   data (e.g. a summary PCA for 19 bioclimatic layers). Visualizations of
   three-dimensional ecological niches modelled as minimum volume
   ellipsoids are developed with ancillary statistics. This niche model is
   then projected to geographic space, to represent a corresponding
   potential suitability map. Usingntboxallows a fast and straightforward
   means by which to retrieve and manipulate occurrence and environmental
   data, which can then be implemented in model calibration, projection and
   evaluation for assessing distributions of species in geographic space
   and their corresponding environmental combinations.},

Title = {SizeExtractR: A workflow for rapid reproducible extraction of object
   size metrics from scaled images},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Size is a biological characteristic that drives ecological processes
   from microscopic to geographic spatial scales, influencing cellular
   energetics, species fitness, population dynamics, and ecological
   interactions. Methods to measure size from images (e.g., proxies of body
   size, leaf area, and cell area) occur along a gradient from manual
   approaches to fully automated technologies (e.g., machine learning).
   These methods differ in terms of time investment, expertise required,
   and data or resource availability. While manual methods can improve
   accuracy through human recognition, they can be labor intensive,
   highlighting the need for semi-automated, and user-friendly software or
   workflows to increase the efficiency of manual techniques. Here, we
   present SizeExtractR, an open-source workflow that enables faster
   extraction of size metrics from scaled images (e.g., each image includes
   a ruler) using semi-automated protocols. It comprises a set of ImageJ
   macros to speed up size extraction and annotation, and an R-package for
   the quality control of annotations, data collation, calibration, and
   visualization. SizeExtractR extracts seven common size dimensions,
   including planar area, min/max diameter, and perimeter. Users can record
   additional categorical variables relating to their own study, for
   example species ID, by simply adding alphanumeric annotations to
   individual objects when prompted. Using a population size structure case
   study for hard corals as an example, we show how SizeExtractR was used
   to quantify the impact of mass coral bleaching on coral population
   dynamics. Lastly, the time saving benefit of using SizeExtractR was
   quantified during a series of timed image analyses, revealing up to a

Title = {Ecological impact assessment of climate change and habitat loss on
   wetland vertebrate assemblages of the Great Barrier Reef catchment and
   the influence of survey bias},

Abstract = {Wetlands are among the most vulnerable ecosystems, stressed by habitat
   loss and degradation from expanding and intensifying agricultural and
   urban areas. Climate change will exacerbate the impacts of habitat loss
   by altering temperature and rainfall patterns. Wetlands within
   Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchment are not different,
   stressed by extensive cropping, urban expansion, and alteration for
   grazing. Understanding how stressors affect wildlife is essential for
   the effective management of biodiversity values and minimizing
   unintended consequences when trading off the multiple values wetlands
   support. Impact assessment is difficult, often relying on an aggregation
   of ad hoc observations that are spatially biased toward easily
   accessible areas, rather than systematic and randomized surveys. Using a
   large aggregate database of ad hoc observations, this study aimed to
   examine the influence of urban proximity on machine-learning models
   predicting taxonomic richness and assemblage turnover, relative to other
   habitat, landscape, and climate variables, for vertebrates dwelling in
   the wetlands of the GBR catchment. The distance from the nearest city
   was, by substantial margins, the most influential factor in predicting
   the richness and assemblage turnover of all vertebrate groups, except
   fish. Richness and assemblage turnover was predicted to be greatest
   nearest the main urban centers. The extent of various wetland habitats
   was highly influential in predicting the richness of all groups, while
   climate (predominately the rainfall in the wettest quarter) was highly
   influential in predicting assemblage turnover for all groups. Bias of
   survey records toward urban centers strongly influenced our ability to
   model wetland-affiliated vertebrates and may obscure our understanding
   of how vertebrates respond to habitat loss and climate change. This
   reinforces the need for randomized and systematic surveys to supplement
   existing ad hoc surveys. We urge modelers in other jurisdictions to
   better portray the potential influence of survey biases when modeling
   species distributions.},

Title = {Progress and opportunities in advancing near-term forecasting of
   freshwater quality},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1691-1714},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Near-term freshwater forecasts, defined as sub-daily to decadal future
   predictions of a freshwater variable with quantified uncertainty, are
   urgently needed to improve water quality management as freshwater
   ecosystems exhibit greater variability due to global change. Shifting
   baselines in freshwater ecosystems due to land use and climate change
   prevent managers from relying on historical averages for predicting
   future conditions, necessitating near-term forecasts to mitigate
   freshwater risks to human health and safety (e.g., flash floods, harmful
   algal blooms) and ecosystem services (e.g., water-related recreation and
   tourism). To assess the current state of freshwater forecasting and
   identify opportunities for future progress, we synthesized freshwater
   forecasting papers published in the past 5 years. We found that
   freshwater forecasting is currently dominated by near-term forecasts of
   water quantity and that near-term water quality forecasts are fewer in
   number and in the early stages of development (i.e., non-operational)
   despite their potential as important preemptive decision support tools.
   We contend that more freshwater quality forecasts are critically needed
   and that near-term water quality forecasting is poised to make
   substantial advances based on examples of recent progress in forecasting
   methodology, workflows, and end-user engagement. For example, current
   water quality forecasting systems can predict water temperature,
   dissolved oxygen, and algal bloom/toxin events 5 days ahead with
   reasonable accuracy. Continued progress in freshwater quality
   forecasting will be greatly accelerated by adapting tools and approaches
   from freshwater quantity forecasting (e.g., machine learning modeling
   methods). In addition, future development of effective operational
   freshwater quality forecasts will require substantive engagement of end
   users throughout the forecast process, funding, and training
   opportunities. Looking ahead, near-term forecasting provides a hopeful
   future for freshwater management in the face of increased variability
   and risk due to global change, and we encourage the freshwater
   scientific community to incorporate forecasting approaches in water
   quality research and management.},

Title = {A spatially explicit risk assessment of salamander populations to
   Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in the United States},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2316-2329},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim Amphibian populations are threatened globally by anthropogenic
   change and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen
   causing chytridiomycosis disease to varying degrees of severity. A
   closely related new fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans
   (Bsal), has recently left its supposed native range in Asia and
   decimated some salamander populations in Europe. Despite being noticed
   initially for causing chytridiomycosis-related population declines in
   salamanders, Bsal can also infect anurans and cause non-lethal
   chytridiomycosis or asymptomatic infections in salamanders. Bsal has not
   yet been detected in the United States, but given the United States has
   the highest salamander biodiversity on Earth, predictive assessments of
   salamander risk to Bsal infection will enable proactive allocation of
   research and conservation efforts into disease prevention and
   mitigation. Location The United States, Europe and Asia. Methods We
   first predicted the environmental suitability for the Bsal pathogen in
   the United States through an ecological niche model based on the
   pathogen's known native range in Asia, validated on the observed
   invasive range in Europe using bioclimatic, land cover, elevation, soil
   characteristics and human modification variables. Second, we predicted
   the susceptibility of salamander species to Bsal infection using a
   machine-learning model that correlated life history traits with
   published data on confirmed species infections. Finally, we mapped the
   geographic ranges of the subset of species that were predicted to be
   susceptible to Bsal infection. Results In the United States, the overlap
   of environmental suitability and susceptible salamander species was
   greatest in the Pacific Northwest, near the Gulf of Mexico, and along
   the Atlantic coast, and in inland states east of the Plains region. Main
   Conclusions The overlap of these metrics identify salamander populations
   that may be at risk of developing Bsal infection and suggests priorities
   for pre-emptive research and conservation measures to protect at-risk
   salamander species from an additional pathogenic threat.},

Title = {Invasion of freshwater ecosystems is promoted by network connectivity to
   hotspots of human activity},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {645-655},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aim Hotspots of human activity are focal points for ecosystem
   disturbance and non-native introduction, from which invading populations
   disperse and spread. As such, connectivity to locations used by humans
   may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in
   freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we
   tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational
   activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems.
   Location England, UK.
   Time period 1990-2018.
   Major taxa studied One hundred and twenty-six non-native freshwater
   birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants.
   Methods Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human
   recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water
   sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which
   human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean
   distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance
   (downstream, upstream and along-channel connectivity). Generalized
   linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to
   invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other
   anthropogenic and environmental drivers.
   Results Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects
   on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation
   had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high
   risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream
   human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the
   groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An
   exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important,
   possibly because of overland dispersal capacity.
   Main conclusions These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater
   invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity
   and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing
   alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our
   approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread
   mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence
   to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for
   invasive non-native species.},

Title = {Modeling the role of the close- range effect and environmental variables

Abstract = {Phragmites australis, a native helophyte in coastal areas of the Baltic
   Sea, has significantly spread on the Finnish coast in the last decades
   raising ecological questions and social interest and concern due to the
   important role it plays in the ecosystem dynamics of shallow coastal
   areas. Despite its important implications on the planning and management
   of the area, predictive modeling of Phragmites distribution is not well
   studied. We examined the prevalence and progression of Phragmites in
   four sites along the Southern Finnish coast in multiple time frames in
   relation to a number of predictors. We also analyzed patterns of
   neighborhood effect on the expansion and disappearance of Phragmites in
   a cellular data model. We developed boosted regression trees models to
   predict Phragmites occurrences and produce maps of habitat suitability.
   Various Phragmites spread figures were observed in different areas and
   time periods, with a minimum annual expansion rate of 1\% and a maximum
   of 8\%. The water depth, shore openness, and proximity to river mouths
   were found influential in Phragmites distribution. The neighborhood
   configuration partially explained the dynamics of Phragmites colonies.
   The boosted regression trees method was successfully used to interpolate
   and extrapolate Phragmites distributions in the study sites highlighting
   its potential for assessing habitat suitability for Phragmites along the
   Finnish coast. Our findings are useful for a number of applications.
   With variables easily available, delineation of areas susceptible for
   Phragmites colonization allows early management plans to be made. Given
   the influence of reed beds on the littoral species and ecosystem, these
   results can be useful for the ecological studies of coastal areas. We
   provide estimates of habitat suitability and quantification of
   Phragmites expansion in a form suitable for dynamic modeling, which
   would be useful for predicting future Phragmites distribution under
   different scenarios of land cover change and Phragmites spatial
   configuration.},

Abstract = {Fruit bats (Pteropodidae) have received increased attention after the
   recent emergence of notable viral pathogens of bat origin. Their
   vagility hinders data collection on abundance and distribution, which
   constrains modeling efforts and our understanding of bat ecology, viral
   dynamics, and spillover. We addressed this knowledge gap with models and
   data on the occurrence and abundance of nectarivorous fruit bat
   populations at 3 day roosts in southeast Queensland. We used
   environmental drivers of nectar production as predictors and explored
   relationships between bat abundance and virus spillover. Specifically,
   we developed several novel modeling tools motivated by complexities of
   fruit bat foraging ecology, including: (1) a dataset of spatial
   variables comprising Eucalypt-focused vegetation indices, cumulative
   precipitation, and temperature anomaly; (2) an algorithm that associated
   bat population response with spatial covariates in a spatially and
   temporally relevant way given our current understanding of bat foraging
   behavior; and (3) a thorough statistical learning approach to finding
   optimal covariate combinations. We identified covariates that classify
   fruit bat occupancy at each of our three study roosts with 86-93\%
   accuracy. Negative binomial models explained 43-53\% of the variation in
   observed abundance across roosts. Our models suggest that spatiotemporal
   heterogeneity in Eucalypt-based food resources could drive at least 50\%
   of bat population behavior at the landscape scale. We found that 13
   spillover events were observed within the foraging range of our study
   roosts, and they occurred during times when models predicted low
   population abundance. Our results suggest that, in southeast Queensland,
   spillover may not be driven by large aggregations of fruit bats
   attracted by nectar-based resources, but rather by behavior of smaller
   resident subpopulations. Our models and data integrated remote sensing
   and statistical learning to make inferences on bat ecology and disease
   dynamics. This work provides a foundation for further studies on
   landscape-scale population movement and spatiotemporal disease dynamics.},

Title = {Beyond presence mapping: predicting fractional cover of non-native
   vegetation in Sentinel-2 imagery using an ensemble of MaxEnt models},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Abstract = {Non-native species maps are important tools for understanding and
   managing biological invasions. We demonstrate a novel approach to extend
   presence modeling to map fractional cover (FC) of non-native yellow
   sweet clover Melilotus officinalis in the Northern Great Plains, USA. We
   used ensembles of MaxEnt models to map FC across landscapes from
   satellite imagery trained from regional aerial imagery that was trained
   by local unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. Clover cover from field
   surveys and classified UAV imagery were nearly identical (n = 22, R-2 =
   0.99). Two classified UAV images provided training data to map clover
   presence with MaxEnt and National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP)
   aerial imagery. We binned cover predictions from NAIP imagery within
   each Sentinel-2 pixel into eight cover classes to create pure (100\%)
   and FC (20\%-95\%) training data and modeled each class separately using
   MaxEnt and Sentinel-2 imagery. We mapped pure clover with one
   classification threshold and compared its performance to 15 candidate
   maps that included FC predictions outside pure predictions. Each FC map
   represented alternative combinations of five MaxEnt thresholds and three
   approaches to assign cover to pixels with multiple predictions from the
   FC ensemble. Evaluations of performance with independent datasets
   revealed maps including FC corresponded to field (n = 32, R-2 range:
   0.39-0.68) and UAV (n = 20, R-2 range: 0.61-0.84) data better than pure
   clover maps (R-2 = 0.15 and 0.31, respectively). Overall, the pure
   clover map predicted 3.2\% cover, whereas the three best performing FC
   maps predicted 6.6\%-8.0\% cover. Including FC predictions increased
   accuracy and cover predictions which can improve ecological
   understanding of invasions. Our method allows efficient FC mapping for
   vegetative species discernible in UAV imagery and may be especially
   useful for mapping rare, irruptive or patchily distributed species with
   poor representation in field data, which challenges landscape-level
   mapping.},

Title = {Mapping canopy nitrogen-scapes to assess foraging habitat for a
   vulnerable arboreal folivore in mixed-species Eucalyptus forests},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {24},
Pages = {18401-18421},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Herbivore foraging decisions are closely related to plant nutritional
   quality. For arboreal folivores with specialized diets, such as the
   vulnerable greater glider (Petauroides volans), the abundance of
   suitable forage trees can influence habitat suitability and species
   occurrence. The ability to model and map foliar nitrogen would therefore
   enhance our understanding of folivore habitat use at finer scales. We
   tested whether high-resolution multispectral imagery, collected by a
   lightweight and low-cost commercial unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV),
   could be used to predict total and digestible foliar nitrogen (N and
   digN) at the tree canopy level and forest stand-scale from leaf-scale
   chemistry measurements across a gradient of mixed-species Eucalyptus
   forests in southeastern Australia. We surveyed temperate Eucalyptus
   forests across an elevational and topographic gradient from sea level to
   high elevation (50-1200 m a.s.l.) for forest structure, leaf chemistry,
   and greater glider occurrence. Using measures of multispectral leaf
   reflectance and spectral indices, we estimated N and digN and mapped N
   and favorable feeding habitat using machine learning algorithms. Our
   surveys covered 17 Eucalyptus species ranging in foliar N from 0.63\% to
   1.92\% dry matter (DM) and digN from 0.45\% to 1.73\% DM. Both
   multispectral leaf reflectance and spectral indices were strong
   predictors for N and digN in model cross-validation. At the tree level,
   79\% of variability between observed and predicted measures of nitrogen
   was explained. A spatial supervised classification model correctly
   identified 80\% of canopy pixels associated with high N concentrations
   (>= 1\% DM). We developed a successful method for estimating foliar
   nitrogen of a range of temperate Eucalyptus species using UAV
   multispectral imagery at the tree canopy level and stand scale. The
   ability to spatially quantify feeding habitat using UAV imagery allows
   remote assessments of greater glider habitat at a scale relevant to
   support ground surveys, management, and conservation for the vulnerable
   greater glider across southeastern Australia.},

Title = {Better together: Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar
   satellite imagery to inform biodiversity monitoring, ecological research
   and conservation science},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {849-865},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar
   satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high.
   These data have both become standard source of information for
   investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and
   function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of
   the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have
   the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities.
   However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS
   data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly
   used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation.
   2. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an
   overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their
   benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the
   added value for biodiversity research and monitoring.
   3.Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can
   significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as
   the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS
   data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping
   species distribution and community composition, as well as for
   monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will
   benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and
   biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more
   transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting
   widespread open access to satellite imagery.
   4. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track
   subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal
   extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates
   derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become
   a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could
   support the development of essential biodiversity variables.},

Title = {Evidence for niche conservatism in alpine beetles under a climate-driven

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Aim Past glacial cycles have generated lineage diversity in alpine
   habitats, acting as a climate-driven species pump. It is not clear how
   much this process contributes to ecological diversification of alpine
   species. To examine this problem, we test patterns of genetic and
   phenotypic divergence in two co-distributed species complexes of
   flightless alpine ground beetles. Greater differentiation in functional
   traits would indicate that ecological selection is an outcome of
   oscillating climate change, whereas greater differentiation in
   non-ecological traits would indicate niche conservatism. Location The
   Cascades Range and Trinity Mountains of western North America. Taxon
   Nebria paradisi and N. vandykei species complexes (Insecta: Coleoptera:
   Carabidae: Nebriinae). Methods We generated genome-wide single
   nucleotide polymorphism data and mitochondrial sequence data, as well as
   morphological and physiological data, to compare populations spanning
   the range of both species. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses
   were used to infer relationships among taxa and populations in each
   species complex, as well as historical demography. Support vector
   machines were used to test for classification of taxa and populations
   based on ecomorphological, ecophysiological and male reproductive
   traits. Mantel tests were then used to assess associations between
   phenotypic and genetic divergence among populations. Results The N.
   vandykei and N. paradisi species complexes are each comprised of
   genetically distinctive populations exhibiting long-term demographic
   declines. Each phylogeny supports multiple monophyletic groups with
   geographical cohesion. By examining phenotypic traits among populations
   in both species' complexes, we show that reproductive trait divergence
   can discriminate species and population status more effectively than
   ecomorphological or ecophysiological traits. Reproductive and genetic
   divergence are significantly correlated in the N. vandykei species
   complex. Main Conclusions We found limited evidence of ecological
   selection acting on functional traits. Instead, reproductive and genetic
   divergence evolved among isolated populations in both species complexes,
   suggesting niche conservatism may be a common outcome in alpine species
   diversification.},

Abstract = {The sounds of Arctic marine fishes recorded in situ have been largely
   ignored in the literature, despite the successful application of passive
   acoustic monitoring (PAM) for mapping the presence of fishes at lower
   latitudes. Polar cod,Boreogadus saida, is a known soniferous species
   that holds keystone status in the Arctic and for which PAM could be a
   useful tool for understanding their distributions-particularly during
   their spawning seasons during the Arctic winter. PAM recordings from
   Sachs Harbour and Ulukhaktok (covering 1.5 years between them) were
   analysed for fish sounds. A total of 44 grunts and 3 knocks were
   recorded, the majority of which were recorded at Ulukhaktok during
   January. A difference in the number of fish calls was also seen between
   months with the highest number occurring during January. No diurnal
   patterns in the number of fish calls were observed. K-means cluster
   analyses based on the 90\% bandwidth, duration, peak and centre
   frequencies showed three clusters. Type 1 occurred during October
   through April, Type 2 from October through February and Type 3 during
   October. Type 2 calls were only noted near Ulukhaktok and Type 1 calls
   resembled those from polar cod. These results either suggest different
   species or the vocal repertoire of a single species. Based on the
   spectral and temporal characteristics, all fish sounds resembled those
   from gadids. The detection of fish calls and the apparent
   spatio-temporal variation following the expected spawning season of
   polar cod illustrate the potential usefulness of PAM for Arctic
   fishes-particularly at a time when climate change is forcing Arctic
   nations to better prepare for ecological shifts and changing
   predator/prey relationships.},

Title = {Implications of macroinvertebrate taxonomic resolution for freshwater
   assessments using functional traits: The Paute River Basin (Ecuador)
   case},

Abstract = {Aim This study aimed at investigating the taxonomic resolutions (TRs) of
   benthic macroinvertebrates for freshwater assessments in the scope of
   the functional trait approach (FTA). Location Macroinvertebrate samples
   were collected in 22 locations within the Paute River Basin (PRB),
   Ecuador, over three years (2010, 2011 and 2012). Methods Biological
   traits were allocated as scores to the macroinvertebrate data (at genus
   level) through fuzzy coding, using published data. The scores of each
   genus were used to derive scores for the corresponding family. These two
   sets of scores were standardized and compared, they were similar in 82\%
   of the cases. Functional diversity (FD) was described by the rRao index,
   which showed no significant differences between coarse (family level)
   and fine (genus level) TRs. Cluster analyses using the K-means algorithm
   were performed to determine similarities between both rRao data sets.
   The WQ cluster number (K) was varied between 2 and 5 to determine a
   threshold K value (K-th), after which a WQ assessment differed as a
   function of the TR being used. Results K-th was 3. Family-level
   identification in the framework of the FTA in the PRB was suitable in
   detecting changes of macroinvertebrate assemblages (until K-th = 3).
   Main conclusions The proposed methodology could be implemented in other
   basins where decision-makers could decide whether the level of
   functional trait data similarity is sufficient for WQ management
   purposes and whether the defined K-th is acceptable. The reliability of
   the key methodological steps was assessed using performance statistics
   that have rarely been applied to ecological studies. Despite related
   research performed in other regions, the present study is the first
   South American attempt to investigate the effects of TR of benthic
   macroinvertebrates on freshwater bioassessments using functional traits.},

Abstract = {Aim Pollen has been used before to reconstruct Holocene plant diversity
   changes in broadly delimited regions such as continents and countries.
   In this study we ask whether finer-scale differences in plant diversity,
   which are of interest to biogeographers and ecologists, are also
   detectable in the fossil pollen record coming from a single,
   biogeographically complex region of temperate Europe.
   Location Central Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia).
   Taxon Vascular plants.
   Methods Fossil pollen extracted from 18 high-quality profiles was used
   as a proxy of past plant diversity. Pollen counts of tree taxa were
   corrected by pollen productivities and pollen assemblages were resampled
   to 100 grains per sample and 150 grains per 500-year time window. SiZer
   analysis was used to test and visualize multi-scale diversity patterns.
   SiZer maps were compared using principal coordinate analysis, and linear
   modelling was used to identify the best predictors. Pollen composition
   was analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling. K-means
   clustering and indicator species analysis were used to interpret
   ordination results.
   Results Mean Holocene plant diversity is significantly predicted by
   latitude, whilst its temporal pattern varies by biogeographical region.
   Major differences were found between the Mesic and Montane Hercynia
   (relatively low diversity, increasing only in the Late Holocene) and
   Pannonia, the Carpathians and the Warm Hercynia (higher diversity,
   increasing from the Early or Middle Holocene onwards). The low diversity
   in the Middle and Late Holocene is associated with the prevalence of
   woody and acidophilic taxa. High diversity is associated with numerous
   grassland and minerotrophic wetland taxa, crops and weeds.
   Main conclusions Plant diversity and its changes during the Holocene are
   geographically structured across temperate Europe. The main causes
   appear to be differences between biogeographical regions in the dynamics
   of landscape openness and vegetation composition. The differences
   reflect spatial patterns in climate and human impact and their temporal
   changes.},

Title = {Use of Land Facets to Plan for Climate Change: Conserving the Arenas,
   Not the Actors},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {701-710},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Even under the most optimistic scenarios, during the next century
   human-caused climate change will threaten many wild populations and
   species. The most useful conservation response is to enlarge and link
   protected areas to support range shifts by plants and animals. To
   prioritize land for reserves and linkages, some scientists attempt to
   chain together four highly uncertain models (emission scenarios, global
   air-ocean circulation, regional circulation, and biotic response). This
   approach has high risk of error propagation and compounding and produces
   outputs at a coarser scale than conservation decisions. Instead, we
   advocate identifying land facets-recurring landscape units with uniform
   topographic and soil attributes-and designing reserves and linkages for
   diversity and interspersion of these units. This coarse-filter approach
   would conserve the arenas of biological activity, rather than the
   temporary occupants of those arenas. Integrative, context-sensitive
   variables, such as insolation and topographic wetness, are useful for
   defining land facets. Classification procedures such as k-means or fuzzy
   clustering are a good way to define land facets because they can analyze
   millions of pixels and are insensitive to case order. In regions lacking
   useful soil maps, river systems or riparian plants can indicate
   important facets. Conservation planners should set higher representation
   targets for rare and distinctive facets. High interspersion of land
   facets can promote ecological processes, evolutionary interaction, and
   range shift. Relevant studies suggest land-facet diversity is a good
   surrogate for today's biodiversity, but fails to conserve some species.
   To minimize such failures, a reserve design based on land facets should
   complement, rather than replace, other approaches. Designs based on land
   facets are not biased toward data-rich areas and can be applied where no
   maps of land cover exist.},

Title = {Regionalization of forest pattern metrics for the continental United
   States using contiguity constrained clustering and partitioning},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {11-18},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Technological advances have created new opportunities for defining and
   mapping ecological and biogeographical regions on the basis of
   quantitative criteria while generating a need for studies that evaluate
   the sensitivity of ecoregionalizations to clustering methods and
   approaches. In this study, we used a novel regionalization algorithm,
   regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering
   and partitioning (REDCAP), to identify hierarchical regions based on
   measures of forest extent, connectivity, and change for 2109 watersheds
   in the continental U.S. Unlike regionalizations developed using
   non-spatial clustering techniques. REDCAP directly incorporates a
   spatial contiguity constraint into a traditional hierarchical clustering
   method, resulting in contiguous regions that optimize a homogeneity
   measure. Results of our analyses identified nine- and eighteen-class
   Forest Pattern Regions that reflected the influence of natural and
   anthropogenic factors structuring forest extent and fragmentation.
   Because these regions are defined by the forest pattern metrics
   themselves, rather than pre-defined political or ecological units, they
   provide a valuable means for visualizing forest pattern information and
   quantifying forest patterns across a large, diverse geographic area. In
   contrast, regionalizations of the same data using two non-spatial
   methods (k-means clustering and non-spatial average linkage clustering)
   resulted in more homogeneous classes composed of many discontiguous
   units. While it should not be viewed as a replacement for non-spatial
   clustering techniques, REDCAP provides an alternative approach to
   developing ecological regionalizations by placing greater emphasis on
   maintaining the spatial contiguity of units, a property that may be
   desirable in many broad-scale regionalizations because it reduces data
   complexity and facilitates the visualization and interpretation of
   ecological or biogeographic data. ID (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Context Combining field-based assessments with remote-sensing proxies of
   landscape patterns provides the opportunity to monitor terrestrial
   ecosystem health status in support of sustainable development goals
   (SDG). Objectives Linking qualitative field data with quantitative
   remote-sensing imagery to map terrestrial ecosystem health (SDG15.3.1
   ``land degradation neutrality{''}). Methods A field-based approach using
   the Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland-Health (IIRH) protocol was
   applied to classify terrestrial ecosystem health status at the watershed
   level as ``healthy{''}, ``at-risk{''}, and ``unhealthy{''}. Quantitative
   complex landscape metrics derived from Landsat spaceborne data were used
   to explore whether similar health statuses can be retrieved on a broader
   scale. The assignment of terrestrial ecosystem health classes based on
   field and the remotely sensed metrics were tested using multivariate and
   cluster analysis methods. Results According to the IIRH assessments,
   soil surface loss, plant mortality, and invasive species were identified
   as important indicators of health. According to the quantitative
   landscape metrics, ``healthy{''} sites had lower amounts of spectral
   heterogeneity, edge density, and resource leakage. We found a high
   agreement between health clusters based on field and remote-sensing data
   (NMI = 0.91) when using a combined approach of DBSCAN and k-means
   clustering together with non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS).
   Conclusions We provide an exemplary workflow on how to combine
   qualitative field data and quantitative remote-sensing data to assess
   SDGs indicators related to terrestrial ecosystem health. As we used a
   standardized method for field assessments together with publicly
   available satellite data, there is potential to test the
   generalizability and context-dependency of our approach in other arid
   and semi-arid rangelands.},

   perform a reasonable classification. The aims of the present research
   are to assess the efficacy of various classification algorithms and to
   select the optimum number of clusters. Study area: We used a dataset of
   197 400 m(2) releves recorded from Tarbiat Modares University research
   forest located in the north of Iran. Methods: For each releve, a species
   list and the canopy cover were recorded by using Braun-Blanquet
   cover-abundance scale modified by van der Maarel. We considered seven
   classification methods: flexible-beta linkage (beta = -0.25), Ward's
   linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, Modified TWINSPAN, k-means,
   and PAM. Using each of these algorithms, data were classified into 2-21
   cluster levels. Then, values of eight internal evaluators viz. ASW,
   1-C.index, PARTANA, PBC, 1-ISA.pval, ISA.sig.inds, ISAMIC, 1-Morisita as
   well as mean lambda index were calculated for each classification level
   resulted from algorithms. These values were applied in three methods to
   select the appropriate classification algorithm(s). Also, we used those
   values to choose the optimum number of clusters in the selected
   algorithm(s). A discriminate analysis opted for the verification of the
   selected optimums. Results: Our results revealed that, for our data,
   flexible-beta linkage was the proper classification algorithm with 12
   the optimum number of clusters. Despite the vast number of available
   classification algorithms, there is no ultimate best one for all
   vegetation datasets. Therefore scientists need using multiple criteria
   to choose their specific appropriate method. With respect to this, our
   methods and findings could provide a generalized framework for choosing
   the effective method(s) for the subsequent classification analyses.},

Title = {The influence of spatial scale on the congruence of classifications
   circumscribing morphological units of biodiversity},

Abstract = {Aim The `taxonomic impediment' has led to a growing trend in ecology and
   conservation biology to use operational surrogates for species within
   the context of a particular research project. Because such
   `parataxonomic' classifications are typically spatially limited in
   scope, we examined the influence of increasing spatial scale on the
   congruence of two such approaches with a more traditional taxonomic
   classification.
   Location Sturt National Park, north-western New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods Specimens of two ant genera, Camponotus and Rhytidoponera, were
   classified by three independent methods. The `parataxonomic'
   classification assigned specimens to morphospecies without specialist
   taxonomic expertise; the `taxonomic' classification assigned specimens
   to either described species or, where this was not possible, to
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using specialist taxonomic expertise;
   the `phenetic' classification assigned specimens to putative species
   using a K-means partitioning algorithm on basic morphometric data.
   Specimens of each genus were pooled into `assemblages', which were
   defined at multiple spatial scales using a nested sampling design.
   Congruence in the interspecimen relationships of the different
   classifications was tested for each assemblage using pair-wise Mantel
   correlations.
   Results Classification congruence tended to decrease with increasing
   spatial scale. There were, however, clear differences between the
   genera. Parataxonomic-taxonomic congruence was consistently greater for
   Camponotus, while phenetic-taxonomic congruence showed the opposite
   pattern.
   Conclusions Observed patterns in classification congruence are
   attributed to two principal causes: (i) within-species morphological
   variation, including ecotypic variation in Rhytidoponera and caste
   polymorphism in Camponotus; and (ii) a limit to the morphological
   similarity of potentially competing species at small spatial scales.
   Regardless of cause, the decline in agreement as the spatial scale of
   observation is increased has important implications for the measurement
   of biodiversity, particularly when comparing samples over regional,
   continental, and global scales.},

Abstract = {Animal species living in small populations with small ranges may be
   particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. We
   investigated genetic population structure of the camas pocket gopher
   (Thomomys bul-bivorus), a species endemic to the Willamette Valley,
   Oregon, an area strongly affected by human development. Pocket gophers
   collected across much of the range of the species were analyzed for
   genetic structure, diversity, and influences of landscape on gene flow
   using microsatellite markers identified in closely related gopher
   species. We used k-means clustering to group individuals into
   genetically similar clusters based on their locations along principal
   component axes, and we evaluated the strength of evidence for this
   clustering using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC).
   We used mixed-effects modeling to evaluate the influence of rivers and
   hills (represented by slopes) as explana-tory variables for pairwise
   individual genetic distances along principal component axes. Results
   supported a clinal, isola-tion-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance
   model, with greater genetic diversity near the central portion of the
   range. A model with both rivers and slopes was best supported, compared
   to either variable alone or a simple distance model. The Willamette
   River, which divides the range of the camas pocket gopher, appeared to
   have some restrictive effect on gene flow but was not a complete
   barrier. In population-level analyses, we observed strong genetic
   differentiation as well as persistent Wahlund effects, suggesting that
   complex genetic structure exists within a population connected across
   gradients of distance, rivers, and hills. The camas pocket gopher has
   persisted despite persecution as an agricul-tural pest and intensive
   habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, but the future may hold new
   conservation challenges as human population and urban development
   increase in the limited range of this endemic Oregon species.},

Title = {Global soil microbiomes: A new frontline of biome-ecology research},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1120-1132},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim Organisms on our planet form spatially congruent and functionally
   distinct communities, which at large geographical scales are called
   ``biomes{''}. Understanding their pattern and function is vital for
   sustainable use and protection of biodiversity. Current global
   terrestrial biome classifications are based primarily on climate
   characteristics and functional aspects of plant community assembly.
   These and other existing biome schemes do not take account of soil
   organisms, including highly diverse and functionally important microbial
   groups. We aimed to define large-scale structure in the diversity of
   soil microbes (soil microbiomes), pinpoint the environmental drivers
   shaping it and identify resemblance and mismatch with existing
   terrestrial biome schemes. Location Global. Time period Current. Major
   taxa studied Soil eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Methods We collected soil
   samples from natural environments world-wide, incorporating most known
   terrestrial biomes. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize
   soil biotic communities and k-means clustering to define soil
   microbiomes describing the diversity of microbial eukaryotic and
   prokaryotic groups. We used climatic data and soil variables measured in
   the field to identify the environmental variables shaping soil
   microbiome structure. Results We recorded strong correlations among
   fungal, bacterial, archaeal, plant and animal communities, defined a
   system of global soil microbiomes (producing seven biome types for
   microbial eukaryotes and six biome types for prokaryotes) and showed
   that these are typically structured by pH alongside temperature. None of
   the soil microbiomes are directly paralleled by any current terrestrial
   biome scheme, with mismatch most substantial for prokaryotes and for
   microbial eukaryotes in cold climates; nor do they consistently
   distinguish grassland and forest ecosystems. Main conclusions Existing
   terrestrial biome classifications represent a limited surrogate for the
   large-scale diversity patterns of microbial soil organisms. We show that
   empirically defined soil microbiomes are attainable using metabarcoding
   and statistical clustering approaches and suggest that they can have
   wide application in theoretical and applied biodiversity research.},

Title = {Into the deep: the functionality of mesopelagic excursions by an oceanic

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Comprehension of ecological processes in marine animals requires
   information regarding dynamic vertical habitat use. While many pelagic
   predators primarily associate with epipelagic waters, some species
   routinely dive beyond the deep scattering layer. Actuation for
   exploiting these aphotic habitats remains largely unknown. Recent
   telemetry data from oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) in
   the Atlantic show a strong association with warm waters (>20 degrees C)
   less than 200 m. Yet, individuals regularly exhibit excursions into the
   meso-and bathypelagic zone. In order to examine deep-diving behavior in
   oceanic whitetip sharks, we physically recovered 16 pop-up satellite
   archival tags and analyzed the high-resolution depth and temperature
   data. Diving behavior was evaluated in the context of plausible
   functional behavior hypotheses including interactive behaviors, energy
   conservation, thermoregulation, navigation, and foraging. Mesopelagic
   excursions (n = 610) occurred throughout the entire migratory circuit in
   all individuals, with no indication of site specificity. Six
   depth-versus-time descent and ascent profiles were identified. Descent
   profile shapes showed little association with examined environmental
   variables. Contrastingly, ascent profile shapes were related to
   environmental factors and appear to represent unique behavioral
   responses to abiotic conditions present at the dive apex. However,
   environmental conditions may not be the sole factors influencing
   ascents, as ascent mode may be linked to intentional behaviors. While
   dive functionality remains unconfirmed, our study suggests that
   mesopelagic excursions relate to active foraging behavior or navigation.
   Dive timing, prey constituents, and dive shape support foraging as the
   most viable hypothesis for mesopelagic excursions, indicating that the
   oceanic whitetip shark may regularly survey extreme environments (deep
   depths, low temperatures) as a foraging strategy. At the apex of these
   deep-water excursions, sharks exhibit a variable behavioral response,
   perhaps, indicating the presence or absence of prey.},

Abstract = {The sensitivity of a generic cellular automaton model to qualitative and
   quantitative landscape classifications is tested regarding the
   spatio-temporal self-organization of the historical landscape pattern of
   southern Wisconsin (USA).
   The qualitative classification is R.W. Finley's ``Original Vegetation of
   Wisconsin{''} and relies on criteria determined by an expert individual.
   The classification accounts for descriptive information and expert
   knowledge, but is not easily reproducible due to locally subjective
   decisions of class delineations. The quantitative classifications rely
   on a numerical-objective algorithm that ensures classification
   reproducibility and tests for robustness, but do not account for local
   ecosystem knowledge or qualitative detail.
   For model development, a cell in the forest-landscape lattice is chosen
   according to three generic and stochastic rules. The uncorrelated{''}
   rule chooses a cell randomly, the ``correlated{''} rule picks a cell
   within two distances of random length, and the raster{''} rule chooses
   randomly one of four immediate neighbors in the lattice. The so chosen
   cell is then replaced by a cell randomly identified within a circular
   neighborhood of radius r (1 < r < 10).
   Comparisons between model simulations and the empirical forest
   landscapes include temporal dynamics (cluster probability) and spatial
   patterns (fractal dimension, landscape diversity). Results suggest that
   the simulated landscape (1) exhibits self-organization for intermediate
   neighborhoods (r = 3), independent of the classification approach, three
   model-development rules, and two initial and boundary conditions; (2)
   achieves temporal (cluster probability) dynamics and spatial patterns
   (fractal dimension, landscape diversity) consistent with the empirical
   landscape. It is, therefore, concluded that a generic model calibrated
   independently from specific ecological processes may suffice to
   replicate major statistical characteristics of a complex landscape with
   simulations that are robust to various landscape-classification
   approaches. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fire is a stronger driver of forest composition than logging in the
   boreal forest of eastern Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {AimsOur study aimed to: (1) document the preindustrial (1925) forest
   composition prior to extensive logging; (2) document the magnitude of
   changes from 1925 to 2005; and (3) identify the relative influence of
   logging and natural disturbances as drivers of the present-day forest
   composition.
   LocationBoreal forest in central Quebec, eastern Canada.
   MethodsWe used a dense network of georeferenced historical (similar to
   1925) forest plots (n=30033) to document preindustrial forest
   composition. We evaluated the magnitude of changes with the present-day
   using modern plots (1980s to 2000s). We reconstructed a long-term,
   spatially explicit history of logging, spruce budworm outbreaks
   (Choristoneura fumiferana {[}Clem.], SBO), and fire using historical
   maps and field surveys.
   ResultsIn the preindustrial period, late successional coniferous taxa
   (Abies balsamea and Picea spp.) dominated the landscape, whereas early
   successional deciduous taxa (Betula spp. and Populus spp.) were confined
   to recently burned areas. In the present-day landscape, large areas
   dominated by late successional coniferous taxa have been replaced by
   early successional deciduous taxa. Forest communities dominated by early
   successional deciduous taxa increased sharply throughout the study area.
   Logging has been a minor driver of these changes compared to fire and
   SBOs.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the importance of documenting the
   long-term history of both anthropogenic and natural disturbances in
   order to assess their relative contributions to the development of the
   present-day forest ecosystems. Natural disturbances have remained the
   main drivers of forest composition during the 20th century, whereas
   logging played a less important role. In the current context of global
   change, long-term experimental research is required to help forecast
   impacts of natural disturbances and forest management on boreal forest
   composition.},

Abstract = {This study provides the first assessment of carabid beetle diversity in
   a natural forest context that encompasses a complete black spruce (Picea
   mariana) natural succession. Boreal forest conservation has been based
   on several assumptions about forest age that only consider species
   richness without accounting for species composition. It has also been
   guided by studies of incomplete chronologies that do not include
   naturally burned or old-growth stages. Twenty-one forest stands of
   different ages following fire - from recently burned to old-growth
   stages (0-340 years of age) - were sampled, revealing a strong
   relationship between age of forest and diversity of Carabidae. Over
   time, species richness followed a parabolic U-shaped pattern both with
   observed (Obs) and predicted richness (ACE). Chronological clustering
   identified four groups of species in the succession: the `burned' group
   characterized 0-2-year-old forests, `regenerating' (21-58 year),
   `mature' (70-170 year) and `old-growth' (177-340 year). The time spans
   corresponding to each of these assemblages lengthen with age of forest
   at an exponential rate. Ward's and K-means (clustering without
   constraint) provided support for the four assemblages but showed
   variation between individual successions, particularly for the
   `regenerating' assemblage, identified as the most heterogeneous. The
   IndVal method identified characteristic species in every stage of the
   succession, particularly Sericoda spp. in the burned stage and Dromius
   piceus and Platynus mannerheinmii associated with old-growth stands. The
   results obtained here show that diversity of Carabidae varies in
   primeval conditions according to age of forest and such variation should
   be taken into account when conservation issues are involved. (C) 2007

Title = {Global biogeochemical provinces of the mesopelagic zone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {500-514},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim: Following the biogeographical approach implemented by Longhurst for
   the epipelagic layer, we propose here to identify a biogeochemical 3-D
   partition for the mesopelagic layer. The resulting partition
   characterizes the main deep environmental biotopes and their vertical
   boundaries on a global scale, which can be used as a geographical and
   ecological framework for conservation biology, ecosystem-based
   management and for the design of oceanographic investigations.
   Location: The global ocean.
   Methods: Based on the most comprehensive environmental climatology
   available to date, which is both spatially and vertically resolved
   (seven environmental parameters), we applied a combination of clustering
   algorithms (c-means, k-means, partition around medoids and agglomerative
   with Ward's linkage) associated with a nonparametric environmental model
   to identify the vertical and spatial delineation of the mesopelagic
   layer.
   Results: First, we show via numerical interpretation that the vertical
   division of the pelagic zone varies and, hence, is not constant
   throughout the global ocean. Indeed, a latitudinal gradient is found
   between the epipelagic-mesopelagic and mesopelagic-bathypelagic vertical
   limits. Second, the mesopelagic layer is shown here to be composed of 13
   distinguishable Biogeochemical Provinces. Each province shows a distinct
   range of environmental conditions and characteristic 3-D distributions.
   Main conclusions: The historical definition of the mesopelagic zone is
   here revisited to define a 3-D geographical framework and characterize
   all the deep environmental biotopes of the deep global ocean. According
   to the numerical interpretation of mesopelagic boundaries, we reveal
   that the vertical division of the zone is not constant over the global
   ocean (200-1,000 m) but varies between ocean basin and with latitude. We
   also provide evidence of biogeochemical division of the mesopelagic zone
   that is spatially structured in a similar way than the epipelagic in the
   shallow waters but varies in the deep owing to a change of the
   environmental driving factors.},

Title = {Identifying latent behavioural states in animal movement with M4, a
   nonparametric Bayesian method},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {432-446},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding animal movement often relies upon telemetry and biologging
   devices. These data are frequently used to estimate latent behavioural
   states to help understand why animals move across the landscape. While
   there are a variety of methods that make behavioural inferences from
   biotelemetry data, some features of these methods (e.g. analysis of a
   single data stream, use of parametric distributions) may limit their
   generality to reliably discriminate among behavioural states. To address
   some of the limitations of existing behavioural state estimation models,
   we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian framework called the
   mixed-membership method for movement (M4), which is available within the
   open-source bayesmove R package. This framework can analyse multiple
   data streams (e.g. step length, turning angle, acceleration) without
   relying on parametric distributions, which may capture complex
   behaviours more successfully than current methods. We tested our
   Bayesian framework using simulated trajectories and compared model
   performance against two segmentation methods (behavioural change point
   analysis (BCPA) and segclust2d), one machine learning method
   {[}expectation-maximization binary clustering (EMbC)] and one type of
   state-space model {[}hidden Markov model (HMM)]. We also illustrated
   this Bayesian framework using movements of juvenile snail kites
   Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. The Bayesian framework estimated
   breakpoints more accurately than the other segmentation methods for
   tracks of different lengths. Likewise, the Bayesian framework provided
   more accurate estimates of behaviour than the other state estimation
   methods when simulations were generated from less frequently considered
   distributions (e.g. truncated normal, beta, uniform). Three behavioural
   states were estimated from snail kite movements, which were labelled as
   `encamped', `area-restricted search' and `transit'. Changes in these
   behaviours over time were associated with known dispersal events from
   the nest site, as well as movements to and from possible breeding
   locations. Our nonparametric Bayesian framework estimated behavioural
   states with comparable or superior accuracy compared to the other
   methods when step lengths and turning angles of simulations were
   generated from less frequently considered distributions. Since the most
   appropriate parametric distributions may not be obvious a priori,
   methods (such as M4) that are agnostic to the underlying distributions
   can provide powerful alternatives to address questions in movement
   ecology.},

Title = {Understanding and Modeling Forest Disturbance Interactions at the
   Landscape Level},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic, affect the configuration,
   composition, and function of forested ecosystems. Complex system
   behaviors emerge from the interactions between disturbance regimes, the
   vegetation response to those disturbances, and their interplay with
   multiple drivers (climate, topography, land use, etc.) across spatial
   and temporal scales. Here, we summarize conceptual advances and
   empirical approaches to disturbance interaction investigation, and used
   those insights to evaluate and categorize 146 landscape modeling studies
   emerging from a systematic review of the literature published since
   2010. Recent conceptual advances include formal disaggregation of
   disturbances into their constituent components, embedding disturbance
   processes into system dynamics, and clarifying terminology for
   interaction factors, types, and ecosystem responses. Empirical studies
   investigating disturbance interactions now span a wide range of
   approaches, including (most recently) advanced statistical methods
   applied to an expanding set of spatial and temporal datasets. Concurrent
   development in spatially-explicit landscape models, informed by these
   empirical insights, integrate the interactions among natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances by coupling these processes to account for
   disturbance stochasticity, disturbance within and across scales, and
   non-linear landscape responses to climate change. Still, trade-offs
   between model elegance and complexity remain. We developed an index for
   the degree of process integration (i.e., balance of static vs. dynamic
   components) within a given disturbance agent and applied it to the
   studies from our systematic review. Contemporary model applications in
   this line of research have applied a wide range process integration,
   depending on the specific question, but also limited in part by data and
   knowledge. Non-linear ``threshold{''} behavior and cross-scaled
   interactions remain a frontier in temperate, boreal, and alpine regions
   of North America and Europe, while even simplistic studies are lacking
   from other regions of the globe (e.g., subtropical and tropical biomes).
   Understanding and planning for uncertainty in system behavior-including
   disturbance interactions-is paramount at a time of accelerated
   anthropogenic change. While progress in landscape modeling studies in
   this area is evident, work remains to increase model transparency and

Title = {The macroecology and evolution of avian competence for Borrelia
   burgdorferi},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Aim: Prediction of novel reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens would be
   improved by the identification of interspecific drivers of host
   competence (i.e., the ability to transmit pathogens to new hosts or
   vectors). Tick-borne pathogens can provide a useful model system,
   because larvae become infected only when feeding on a competent host
   during their first blood meal. For tick-borne diseases, competence has
   been studied best for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), which
   causes Lyme borreliosis. Major reservoirs include several small mammal
   species, but birds might play an under-recognized role in human risk
   given their ability to disperse infected ticks across large spatial
   scales. Here, we provide a global synthesis of the ecological and
   evolutionary factors that determine the ability of bird species to
   infect larval ticks with Bbsl.
   Location; Global.
   Time period: 1983-2019.
   Major taxa studied: Birds.
   Methods: We compiled a dataset of Bbsl competence across 183 bird
   species and applied meta-analysis, phylogenetic factorization and
   boosted regression trees to describe spatial and temporal patterns in
   competence, characterize its phylogenetic distribution across birds,
   reconstruct its evolution and evaluate the trait profiles associated
   with competent avian species.
   Results: Half of the sampled bird species show evidence of competence
   for Bbsl. Competence displays moderate phylogenetic signal, has evolved
   multiple times across bird species and is pronounced in the genus
   Turdus. Trait-based analyses distinguished competent birds with 80\%
   accuracy and showed that such species have low baseline corticosterone,
   exist on both ends of the pace-of-life continuum, breed and winter at
   high latitudes and have broad migratory movements into their breeding
   range. We used these trait profiles to predict various likely but
   unsampled competent species, including novel concentrations of avian
   reservoirs within the Neotropics.
   Main conclusion: Our results can generate new hypotheses for how birds
   contribute to the dynamics of tick-borne pathogens and help to
   prioritize surveillance of likely but unsampled competent birds. Our
   findings also emphasize that birds display under-recognized variation in
   their contributions to enzootic cycles of Bbsl and the broader need to
   consider competence in ecological and predictive studies of multi-host
   pathogens.},

Title = {Collinearity: a review of methods to deal with it and a simulation study
   evaluating their performance},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-46},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables,
   usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any
   descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter
   estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and
   hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant
   predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when
   a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to
   another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To
   demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show
   how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over
   spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different
   approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed,
   ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection,
   through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using
   simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing
   complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address
   collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning
   approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its
   impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the
   methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a
   training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance
   on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods
   specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods
   and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and
   threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in
   combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and
   threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in
   the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded
   degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the folk
   lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables
   of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to
   severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of
   ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable
   selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches
   reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

Title = {Novel species interactions: American black bears respond to Pacific
   herring spawn},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Background: In addition to the decline and extinction of the world's
   species, the decline and eventual loss of species interactions is one of
   the major consequences of the biodiversity crisis. On the Pacific coast
   of North America, diminished runs of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) drive
   numerous marine-terrestrial interactions, many of which have been
   intensively studied, but marine-terrestrial interactions driven by other
   species remain relatively unknown. Bears (Ursus spp.) are major vectors
   of salmon into terrestrial ecosystems, but their participation in other
   cross-ecosystem interactions is similarly poorly described. Pacific
   herring (Clupea pallasii), a migratory forage fish in coastal marine
   ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean and the dominant forage fish in
   British Columbia (BC), spawn in nearshore subtidal and intertidal zones.
   Spawn resources (eggs, milt, and spawning adults) at these events are
   available to coastal predators and scavengers, including terrestrial
   species. In this study, we investigated the interaction between American
   black bears (Ursus americanus) and Pacific herring at spawn events in
   Quatsino Sound, BC, Canada.
   Results: Using remote cameras to monitor bear activity (1,467 camera
   days, 29 sites, years 2010-2012) in supratidal and intertidal zones and
   a machine learning approach, we determined that the quantity of Pacific
   herring eggs in supratidal and intertidal zones was a leading predictor
   of black bear activity, with bears positively responding to increasing
   herring egg masses. Other important predictors included day of the year
   and Talitrid amphipod (Traskorchestia spp.) mass. A complementary
   analysis of black bear scats indicated that Pacific herring egg mass was
   the highest ranked predictor of egg consumption by bears. Pacific
   herring eggs constituted a substantial yet variable component of the
   early springtime diet of black bears in Quatsino Sound (frequency of
   occurrence 0-34\%; estimated dietary content 0-63\%). Other major
   dietary items included graminoids (grasses and sedges), Phaeophyta
   (brown algae), Zosteraceae (seagrasses), and Talitrid amphipods.
   Conclusion: This research represents the first scientific evidence of a
   cross-ecosystem interaction between Pacific herring and American black
   bears. Our findings also expand knowledge of the ecological roles of
   both species. Combined, evidence of anthropogenic constraints on both
   black bears and Pacific herring suggests that bear-herring interactions
   were potentially stronger and more widespread in the past.},

Title = {Phylodynamic analysis of an emergent Mycobacterium bovis outbreak in an

Abstract = {Understanding how emergent pathogens successfully establish themselves
   and persist in previously unaffected populations is a crucial problem in
   disease ecology, with important implications for disease management. In
   multi-host pathogen systems this problem is particularly difficult, as
   the importance of each host species to transmission is often poorly
   characterised, and the disease epidemiology is complex. Opportunities to
   observe and analyse such emergent scenarios are few. Here, we exploit a
   unique dataset combining densely collected data on the epidemiological
   and evolutionary characteristics of an outbreak of Mycobacterium bovis
   (the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, bTB) in a population of
   cattle and badgers in an area considered low risk for bTB, with no
   previous record of either persistent infection in cattle, or of any
   infection in wildlife. We analyse the outbreak dynamics using a
   combination of mathematical modelling, Bayesian evolutionary analyses
   and machine learning. Comparison to M. bovis whole-genome sequences from
   Northern Ireland confirmed this to be a pathogen single introduction
   from the latter region, with evolutionary analysis supporting an
   introduction directly into the local cattle population 6 years prior to
   its first discovery in badgers. Once introduced, the evidence supports
   M. bovis epidemiological dynamics passing through two phases, the first
   dominated by cattle-to-cattle transmission before becoming established
   in the local badger population. Synthesis and applications. The
   Mycobacterium bovis emergent outbreak that was the object of this study
   was of considerable concern because of the geographical distance from
   previously known high-risk areas. Initial decisions about the outbreak
   control were supported by the whole-genome sequencing data. The further
   analyses described here were used to estimate the time of introduction
   (and therefore the likely magnitude of any hidden outbreak) and the
   rates of cross-species transmission, and provided valuable confirmation
   that the extent and focus of the imposed controls were appropriate. Not
   only do these findings strengthen the call for genomic surveillance, but
   they also pave the path for future outbreaks control, providing insights
   for more rapid and decisive evidence-based decision-making. As the
   methods we used and developed are agnostic to the disease itself, they
   are also valuable for other slowly transmitting pathogens.},

Abstract = {Significant progress has been made in providing guidelines and
   recommendations for assessing the ecological niche, stage of invasion,
   and probability of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) potential
   distribution in space and time. We followed these recommendations by
   developing and comparing ordination and species distribution models
   (SDMs) of two important woody IAPS in Eastern Africa, Prosopis juliflora
   and Lantana camara, and interpreting the results to inform IAPS
   management. The two species differ in their invasion history in Eastern
   Africa; while L. camara was widely introduced there in the 19th century,
   P. juliflora was only planted at selected locations in the 1970s and
   1980s. For the SDMs, machine learning algorithms were used to generate
   one ensemble model each for P. juliflora and L. camara. For ordination,
   we used bioclimatic variables, performed a principal component analysis,
   and compared the native and global niches of the species with the
   Eastern African niche. Niches varied substantially depending on the
   percentage of marginal climates excluded from the models. Additional
   analysis of the local niches surrounding the original P. juliflora
   plantations showed that they are complementary, which may have led to an
   overestimation of regional niche filling. While niche expansion was
   absent or small depending on the percentage of marginal climates
   excluded, analysis of the stages of invasion suggested that P. juliflora
   may have started to adapt to novel climatic conditions and that L.
   camara is approaching a pseudo-stable equilibrium in Eastern Africa. The
   SDMs showed that large areas in Eastern Africa that have not yet been
   invaded by P. juliflora are suitable or will become suitable with
   climate change. For L. camara, the global SDM predicted a considerably
   larger suitable area than the Eastern African one, raising uncertainty
   about the areas to be included in a regional management strategy. Thus,
   combining ordination and SDMs and integrating a geographic component
   into ordination is useful in assessing IAPS invasion stages and
   potential niche shifts, and the results help inform IAPS policy and
   management. The combined approach can also serve to guide experimental
   studies addressing divergences between results generated with the
   different approaches.},

Abstract = {Biologists routinely fit novel and complex statistical models to push
   the limits of our understanding. Examples include, but are not limited
   to, flexible Bayesian approaches (e.g. BUGS, stan), frequentist and
   likelihood-based approaches (e.g. packages lme4) and machine learning
   methods.These software and programs afford the user greater control and
   flexibility in tailoring complex hierarchical models. However, this
   level of control and flexibility places a higher degree of
   responsibility on the user to evaluate the robustness of their
   statistical inference. To determine how often biologists are running
   model diagnostics on hierarchical models, we reviewed 50 recently
   published papers in 2021 in the journal Nature Ecology \& Evolution, and
   we found that the majority of published papers did not report any
   validation of their hierarchical models, making it difficult for the
   reader to assess the robustness of their inference. This lack of
   reporting likely stems from a lack of standardized guidance for best
   practices and standard methods.Here, we provide a guide to understanding
   and validating complex models using data simulations. To determine how
   often biologists use data simulation techniques, we also reviewed 50
   recently published papers in 2021 in the journal Methods Ecology \&
   Evolution. We found that 78\% of the papers that proposed a new
   estimation technique, package or model used simulations or generated
   data in some capacity (18 of 23 papers); but very few of those papers (5
   of 23 papers) included either a demonstration that the code could
   recover realistic estimates for a dataset with known parameters or a
   demonstration of the statistical properties of the approach. To distil
   the variety of simulations techniques and their uses, we provide a
   taxonomy of simulation studies based on the intended inference. We also
   encourage authors to include a basic validation study whenever novel
   statistical models are used, which in general, is easy to
   implement.Simulating data helps a researcher gain a deeper understanding
   of the models and their assumptions and establish the reliability of
   their estimation approaches. Wider adoption of data simulations by
   biologists can improve statistical inference, reliability and open
   science practices.},

Title = {Pattern-recognition ecological niche models fit to presence-only and
   presence-absence data},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},
Pages = {761-770},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Identifying the boundary of a species' niche from observational and
   environmental data is a common problem in ecology and conservation
   biology and a variety of techniques have been developed or applied to
   model niches and predict distributions. Here, we examine the performance
   of some pattern-recognition methods as ecological niche models (ENMs).
   Particularly, one-class pattern recognition is a flexible and seldom
   used methodology for modelling ecological niches and distributions from
   presence-only data. The development of one-class methods that perform
   comparably to two-class methods (for presence/absence data) would remove
   modelling decisions about sampling pseudo-absences or background data
   points when absence points are unavailable.
   2. We studied nine methods for one-class classification and seven
   methods for two-class classification (five common to both), all
   primarily used in pattern recognition and therefore not common in
   species distribution and ecological niche modelling, across a set of 106
   mountain plant species for which presence-absence data was available. We
   assessed accuracy using standard metrics and compared trade-offs in
   omission and commission errors between classification groups as well as
   effects of prevalence and spatial autocorrelation on accuracy.
   3. One-class models fit to presence-only data were comparable to
   two-class models fit to presence-absence data when performance was
   evaluated with a measure weighting omission and commission errors
   equally. One-class models were superior for reducing omission errors
   (i.e. yielding higher sensitivity), and two-classes models were superior
   for reducing commission errors (i.e. yielding higher specificity). For
   these methods, spatial autocorrelation was only influential when
   prevalence was low.
   4. These results differ from previous efforts to evaluate alternative
   modelling approaches to build ENM and are particularly noteworthy
   because data are from exhaustively sampled populations minimizing false
   absence records. Accurate, transferable models of species' ecological
   niches and distributions are needed to advance ecological research and
   are crucial for effective environmental planning and conservation; the
   pattern-recognition approaches studied here show good potential for
   future modelling studies. This study also provides an introduction to
   promising methods for ecological modelling inherited from the
   pattern-recognition discipline.},

Title = {Scale-dependent effects of roadways on the movement behavior of a
   large-bodied pit viper (Crotalus horridus)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Roadways are among the most widespread and disruptive anthropogenic land
   use features that influence the behavior and movement of wildlife.
   Negative impacts of roadways have been well documented, but the
   behavioral impact of roadways on smaller, cryptic species has yet to be
   thoroughly examined. Using a novel integration of radio telemetry and
   tri-axial accelerometry, we evaluated the effects of roadways on the
   movement behavior of 26 adult Timber Rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) at
   coarse and fine time scales in central Georgia between June 2020 and
   November 2021. To interpret the effect of roads at a coarse time scale,
   we modeled the effect of mean annual distance to roadways (DTR) on
   annual measures of movement and space use by C. horridus using both
   radio telemetry and accelerometry derived metrics (RT and ACT metrics).
   To explore the fine-scale impact of roadways, we quantified RT and ACT
   metrics during confirmed road interactions (i.e., instances when
   individual snakes crossed a road or encountered a road but did not
   cross) and compared these instances to the RT and ACT metrics calculated
   across the remainder of the active season within this subset of snakes.
   Relating the annual RT and ACT metrics to DTR revealed no significant
   associations at a coarse time scale. However, the evaluation of C.
   horridus movement behavior during punctuated road encounters revealed
   that snakes increased RT and ACT metrics during the road interactions
   compared to metrics calculated across the remainder of the active
   season. This might indicate that the abundance of contiguous habitat
   adjacent to roadways at our study site is serving as an adequate buffer
   to any long-term shifts in movement behavior, but the potential hidden
   cost of increasing movement when snakes encounter roads could have
   negative implications for populations that encounter roads more
   frequently, even in the absence of significant direct road mortality.
   Overall, integrating radio telemetry and accelerometry and adopting a
   scale-dependent approach to quantifying movement allowed for a more
   detailed evaluation of the response of C. horridus to roadways. This
   approach holds promise for detecting and interpreting previously
   overlooked short-term alterations in snake movement behavior with
   potentially significant fitness consequences.},

Title = {Model-based unsupervised clustering for distinguishing Cuvier's and
   Gervais' beaked whales in acoustic data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), particularly autonomous platforms,
   offers many advantages in monitoring phonating deep-diving marine
   mammals in oceanic environment. Relevant data can be obtained day and
   night continuously over long durations and in any weather conditions. It
   provides a cost-efficient solution with greater detection ranges when
   compared to traditional large research vessel and aerial visual surveys
   requiring keeping expert observers on station for long periods of time
   and relying on good visibility and calm seas. Therefore, PAM is becoming
   a preferred tool to assess population dynamics trends and health of
   deep-water marine mammal stocks. However the large volumes of collected
   data require robust automatic detection and classification algorithms to
   identify marine mammals in recordings. As for beaked whales, one of the
   challenging automatic processing goals is the identification of
   different species to advance our understanding of their role in the
   marine ecosystem. At present, traditional detection and classification
   methods employ searches for acoustic events above a user-defined
   signal-to-noise ratio threshold in the frequency band of interest and
   further rely on an experienced operator's manual inspection for species
   classification and removal of false positives. Current passive
   monitoring data collection systems yield large volumes of acoustic data,
   therefore a manual classification approach becomes very time-consuming
   and impractical. This paper focuses on developing a multi-stage
   automatic classifier for beaked whale species. The proposed method
   utilizes unsupervised machine clustering of signal attributes extracted
   from potential detection events flagged by an energy-band detector. The
   proposed algorithm was benchmarked against a manually annotated workshop
   dataset and applied to acoustic data collected in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico. The algorithm classifies beaked whale species in automatic mode
   with minimal operator involvement only at the validation stage. When
   compared with the manually annotated classification dataset, the
   proposed method achieved a recall rate of 82.8\% for Cuvier's and 77.9\%
   for Gervais' species in automatic mode. New insights on habitat use by
   different species of beaked whales in the Gulf of Mexico were gained
   when using the species-specific classifier. The high spatial resolution
   acoustic monitoring results showed that the habitat preferences of two
   dominating beaked whale species in the Gulf of Mexico support the
   habitat division (ecological niche) hypothesis.},

Title = {Determinants of reproductive success in dominant pairs of clownfish: a
   boosted regression tree analysis},

Abstract = {P>1. Central questions of behavioural and evolutionary ecology are what
   factors influence the reproductive success of dominant breeders and
   subordinate nonbreeders within animal societies? A complete
   understanding of any society requires that these questions be answered
   for all individuals.
   2. The clown anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, forms simple societies
   that live in close association with sea anemones, Heteractis magnifica.
   Here, we use data from a well-studied population of A. percula to
   determine the major predictors of reproductive success of dominant pairs
   in this species.
   3. We analyse the effect of multiple predictors on four components of
   reproductive success, using a relatively new technique from the field of
   statistical learning: boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRTs have the
   potential to model complex relationships in ways that give powerful
   insight.
   4. We show that the reproductive success of dominant pairs is unrelated
   to the presence, number or phenotype of nonbreeders. This is consistent
   with the observation that nonbreeders do not help or hinder breeders in
   any way, confirming and extending the results of a previous study.
   5. Primarily, reproductive success is negatively related to male growth
   and positively related to breeding experience. It is likely that these
   effects are interrelated because males that grow a lot have little
   breeding experience. These effects are indicative of a trade-off between
   male growth and parental investment.
   6. Secondarily, reproductive success is positively related to female
   growth and size. In this population, female size is positively related
   to group size and anemone size, also. These positive correlations among
   traits likely are caused by variation in site quality and are suggestive
   of a silver-spoon effect.
   7. Noteworthily, whereas reproductive success is positively related to
   female size, it is unrelated to male size. This observation provides
   support for the size advantage hypothesis for sex change: both
   individuals maximize their reproductive success when the larger
   individual adopts the female tactic.
   8. This study provides the most complete picture to date of the factors
   that predict the reproductive success of dominant pairs of clown
   anemonefish and illustrates the utility of BRTs for analysis of complex
   behavioural and evolutionary ecology data.},

Title = {A practical method to account for variation in detection range in
   acoustic telemetry arrays to accurately quantify the spatial ecology of
   aquatic animals},

Abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a popular tool for long-term tracking of aquatic
   animals to describe and quantify patterns of movement, space use, and
   diverse ecological interactions. Acoustic receivers are imperfect
   sampling instruments, and their detection range (DR; the area
   surrounding the receiver in which tag transmissions can be detected)
   often varies dramatically over space and time due to dynamic
   environmental conditions. Therefore, it is prudent to quantify and
   account for variation in DR to prevent telemetry system performance from
   confounding the understanding of real patterns in animal space use.
   However, acoustic receiver DR consists of a complex, dynamic,
   three-dimensional area that is challenging to quantify. Although
   quantifying the absolute DR of all receivers is infeasible in the
   context of most acoustic telemetry studies, we outline a practical
   approach to quantify relative variation among receiver DR over space and
   time. This approach involves selecting a set of sentinel receivers to
   monitor drivers of variation in detection range. Each sentinel receiver
   is subject to a range testing procedure to estimate detection efficiency
   (DE; the proportion of total transmissions detected by the receiver), at
   a range of distances from the receiver, to derive the maximum range (MR;
   distance from the receiver where DE is 5\%) and Midpoint (distance from
   the receiver where DE is 50\%). A reference transmitter is then placed
   at the Midpoint, providing a standardized measure of long-term variation
   in DE, with each station having similar freedom of variance. Variation
   in reference tag DE is then combined with MR to calculate a DR
   correction factor (DRc). A modelling approach is then used to estimate
   DRc for all receivers in the array at spatial and temporal scales of
   ecological interest, which can be used to correct animal detection data
   in various ways. We demonstrate this method with a hypothetical dataset,
   as well as empirical data from an acoustic telemetry array to delineate
   spatio-temporal patterns of fish habitat use. This is a flexible and
   practical approach to account for variation in acoustic receiver
   performance, allowing more accurate spatial and temporal patterns in
   aquatic animal spatial ecology to be revealed.},

Title = {Ecological niche models and species distribution models in marine
   environments: A literature review and spatial analysis of evidence},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {415},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) and species
   distribution models (SDMs) to explore the patterns and processes behind
   observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth.
   Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent
   in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown
   significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a
   systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published
   between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and
   the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed,
   including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed,
   algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 \% were
   at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic
   Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used
   to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms
   underlying geographic ranges (64 \%). A few attempted to evaluate
   impacts of climate change (19 \%) or to develop strategies for
   conservation (11 \%). Several correlative techniques have been used, but
   most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 \%) and
   statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMS (22 \%)
   and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 \%). The groups most studied
   were fish (23 \%), molluscs (16 \%), and marine mammals (14 \%), the
   first two with commercial importance and the last important for
   conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of
   ENMs versus SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate
   between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report
   error and uncertainty associated with species' occurrence records and
   environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third
   dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring
   to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the
   precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance
   the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental
   layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems,
   especially in the case of highly mobile species.},

Title = {Increasingly detailed insights in animal behaviours using continuous
   on-board processing of accelerometer data},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background: Studies of animal behaviour, ecology and physiology are
   continuously benefitting from progressing biologging techniques,
   including the collection of accelerometer data to infer animal
   behaviours and energy expenditure. In one of the most recent
   technological advances in this space, on-board processing of raw
   accelerometer data into animal behaviours proves highly energy-, weight-
   and cost-efficient allowing for continuous behavioural data collection
   in addition to regular positional data in a wide range of animal
   tracking studies. Methods: We implemented this latest development in
   collecting continuous behaviour records from 6 Pacific Black Ducks Anas
   superciliosa to evaluate some of this novel technique's potential
   advantages over tracking studies lacking behavioural data or recording
   accelerometer data intermittently only. We (i) compared the discrepancy
   of time-activity budgets between continuous records and behaviours
   sampled with different intervals, (ii) compared total daily distance
   flown using hourly GPS fixes with and without additional behavioural
   data and (iii) explored how behaviour records can provide additional
   insights for animal home range studies. Results: Using a total of 690
   days of behaviour records across six individual ducks distinguishing
   eight different behaviours, we illustrated the improvement that is
   obtained in time-activity budget accuracy if continuous rather than
   interval-sampled accelerometer data is used. Notably, for rare
   behaviours such as flying and running, error ratios > 1 were common when
   sampling intervals exceeded 10 min. Using 72 days of hourly GPS fixes in
   combination with continuous behaviour records over the same period in
   one individual duck, we showed behaviour-based daily distance estimation
   is significantly higher (up to 540\%) than the distance calculated from
   hourly sampled GPS fixes. Also, with the same 72 days of data for one
   individual duck, we showed how this individual used specific sites
   within its entire home range to satisfy specific needs (e.g. roosting
   and foraging). Conclusion: We showed that by using trackers allowing for
   continuous recording of animal behaviour, substantial improvements in
   the estimation of time-activity budgets and daily traveling distances
   can be made. With integrating behaviour into home-range estimation we
   also highlight that this novel tracking technique may not only improve
   estimations but also open new avenues in animal behaviour research,
   importantly improving our knowledge of an animal's state while it is
   roaming the landscape.},

Title = {Multi-observer methods for estimating uncertain species identification},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Species identification typically is assumed certain in population
   ecology. However, partial identification (to lowest certain taxon) and
   misidentification (collectively ``uncertain identification{''}) have
   pervaded surveys. Consequent bias in occupancy and abundance estimates
   impairs inference and decision-making, but methods for estimating
   uncertain identification and remedying its effects have required
   restrictive assumptions or utilized artificial cues. I present
   likelihood-based multi-observer methods for estimating uncertain
   identification during surveys enumerating individuals, assess
   performance via simulation study, demonstrate application to line
   transects, and provide recommendations for use and further development.
   Methods typically employ three or more independent observers using one
   or more observation methods. Species identity is a latent state, and
   discrepancies in species classifications of the same individuals or
   groups enable estimation of uncertain identification and true species
   composition of detected individuals. Because complete or certain
   classifications are not required for any observer, methods uniquely
   befit surveys for free-ranging, unmarked animals. Methods permit
   arbitrary numbers of species and observation states, multi-species
   groups, covariates, and distinct uncertain identification for each
   species, observer, and observation state. Innovative technologies for
   acquiring recorded observations (e.g., digital media of survey
   observations) complement methods by enabling post hoc classifications by
   independent observers and enhanced species identification (e.g.,
   replays, magnification, spectrograms). Using multi-observation methods
   (MOM), classifications by observers at sampling sites are supplemented
   with classifications from recorded observations by additional observers.
   Alternatively, recorded observations can be acquired solely via
   technology (e.g., unmanned aerial systems, autonomous recording units).
   Multi-observation methods enable supplementing automated classifications
   (e.g., machine learning) with classifications by humans, while
   single-observation methods allow classifications by multiple human
   observers. Simulations demonstrated good model performance and
   robustness, except to high un-modeled heterogeneity in
   misidentification. Minimizing misidentification and other practical
   steps enhance precision and accuracy of results. I applied MOM to line
   transects for two genus Brachyramphus murrelet species by photographing
   a sample of detected groups. Post hoc classifications from photographs
   by three independent observers had lower misidentification and partial
   identification (0.6\%, 9\%) vs. experienced observers at survey sites
   (3.2\%, 23\%). Integrating multi-observer methods with other methods
   (e.g., distance sampling, N-mixture models) enables estimation of
   occupancy or abundance accounting for uncertain detection and
   identification.},

Title = {Predictive mapping of two endemic oak tree species under climate change
   scenarios in a semiarid region: Range overlap and implications for
   conservation},

Abstract = {Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani are two important species
   distributed across most of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq's mountain
   ranges (KRI). They have significant ecological, medicinal, and
   socioeconomic values. Recent studies have documented how plant
   distributions have been impacted by climate change. This study's goal is
   to establish the existing distributions of both species, measure the
   consequences of prospective environmental conditions on their
   distributions, predict possible habitat distributions, map the
   overlapped habitat ranges for the species in the KRI, and identify the
   key factors influencing their distributions. For these aims,
   distribution data points of the species, different environmental
   factors, including the existing climate, three emission predictions for
   the 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s of two general circulation models (GCMs), a
   machine learning approach, and geospatial techniques were used. Modeling
   revealed that the total magnitude of the habitat increase for the
   species would be less than the overall magnitude of the habitat
   contraction. The yearly mean temperature, yearly precipitation, and
   minimum temperature during the coldest period mostly alter the target
   species' geographic dispersion. Across the three emission scenarios of
   the both models, Q. infectoria habitat would contract by 2760.9-2856.9
   km2 (5.36-5.55\%), 2856.9-3357.2 km2 (5.55-6.52\%) and 2822.1-3400.2 km2
   (5.48-6.60\%), whereas it would expand by 1153.3-1638.9 km2
   (2.24-3.18\%), 761.0-1556.8 km2 (1.48-3.02\%), and 721.5-1547.1 km2
   (1.40-3.00\%) for the 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s, respectively. A similar
   pattern was also noted for Q. libani. The two species' habitat ranges in
   KRI would be considerably reduced due to climate change. The species'
   estimated area would extend mostly to the east and southeast of the KRI
   at high altitudes. The mountain areas, notably those where the species
   overlap by 1767.2-1807.5 km2 (3.43-3.51\%) for the two GCMs, must be the
   primary objective of conservation efforts. This research presents new
   baseline data for future research on mountain forest ecosystems and the
   techniques of biodiversity conservation to reduce climate change's
   effects in Iraq.},

Title = {Mapping pollination types with remote sensing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {999-1011},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Questions: Pollination is an ecosystem function that varies at local
   spatial scales. Remote sensing may help to quantify and map the
   resulting patterns for a better understanding of ecosystem functioning.
   This task is challenging because the signal measured by sensors is
   dominated by leaf and canopy optical traits that determine the
   vegetation spectrum. No direct influence of pollination types (i.e.
   wind, insect and self pollination) can be expected. We limits ask: (1)
   lion strongly are pollination types at the community level linked with
   optical traits; and (2) do these links allow us to map spatial patterns
   of pollination types with remote sensing data?
   Location: Mires arid Molinia grasslar, southern C.ernmany.
   Methods: We sampled vascular plant species composition, as well as
   traits related to optical spectral signals, for 100 plots. Information
   on pollination types and additional optical traits were compiled from
   established plant trait databases. Simultaneously with the field
   sampling, image data of the study site were acquired using the airborne
   sensor ABA. Dual. We tested for correlations between-pollination types
   and optical traits. Based on these results, we regressed the plot-based
   information on pollination types against the corresponding spectral
   signal extracted.from the image data. We inverted the models using the
   image in order to obtain maps of the pollination type distribution
   across the study site.
   Results: In our study site, pollination types and optical traits were
   significantly correlated, up to R = 0.813 in the case of wind
   pollination and leaf dry matter content. These relations are, however,
   not.necessarily transferable to other ecosystems, phenological stages
   and spatial scales, and their physical interpretation requires careful
   consideration. We were able to statistically model the spatial
   distribution of pollination types with a RMSE < 10.5\%. The resulting
   maps provide detailed insights into the spatial distribution of
   pollination types at the community level.
   Conclusions: The results show that pollination types are indeed related
   to canopy reflectance in a way that allows their mapping using remote
   sensing. More research is needed in order to improve our knowledge about
   transferable relations between pollination types and plant traits in
   other ecosystems and at different phenological stages.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Leaf morphological traits vary systematically along climatic gradients.
   However, recent studies in plant functional ecology have mainly analysed
   quantitative traits, while numerical models of species distributions and
   vegetation function have focused on traits associated with resource
   acquisition; both ignore the wider functional significance of leaf
   morphology. A dataset comprising 22 leaf morphological traits for 662
   woody species from 92 sites, representing all biomes present in China,
   was subjected to multivariate analysis in order to identify leading
   dimensions of trait covariation (correspondence analysis), quantify
   climatic and phylogenetic contributions (canonical correspondence
   analysis with variation partitioning) and characterise co-occurring
   trait syndromes (k-means clustering) and their climatic preferences.
   Three axes accounted for >20\% of trait variation in both evergreen and
   deciduous species. Moisture index, precipitation seasonality and
   growing-season temperature explained 8\%-10\% of trait variation; family
   15\%-32\%. Microphyll or larger, mid- to dark green leaves with drip
   tips in wetter climates contrasted with nanophyll or smaller glaucous
   leaves without drip tips in drier climates. Thick, entire leaves in less
   seasonal climates contrasted with thin, marginal dissected, aromatic and
   involute/revolute leaves in more seasonal climates. Thick, involute,
   hairy leaves in colder climates contrasted with thin leaves with marked
   surface structures (surface patterning) in warmer climates. Distinctive
   trait clusters were linked to the driest and most seasonal climates, for
   example the clustering of picophyll, fleshy and succulent leaves in the
   driest climates and leptophyll, linear, dissected, revolute or involute
   and aromatic leaves in regions with highly seasonal rainfall. Several
   trait clusters co-occurred in wetter climates, including clusters
   characterised by microphyll, moderately thick, patent and entire leaves
   or notophyll, waxy, dark green leaves. Synthesis. The plastic response
   of size, shape, colour and other leaf morphological traits to climate is
   muted, thus their apparent shift along climate gradients reflects plant
   adaptations to environment at a community level as determined by species
   replacement. Information on leaf morphological traits, widely available
   in floras, could be used to strengthen predictive models of species
   distribution and vegetation function.},

Title = {Phylogenetic regionalization of tree assemblages reveals novel patterns

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Aim We used a phylogenetic approach to group assemblages of woody plant
   into major vegetation units in the Atlantic Forest, thus for the first
   time incorporating information on species evolutionary relationships
   into a bioregionalization of this critical hotspot. A phylogenetic
   regionalization will provide a spatially explicit framework for
   answering many basic and applied questions in biogeography, ecology and
   conservation.
   Location Atlantic Forest.
   Taxon Angiosperms
   Methods Our data set comprises 614 genera and 116 families, spread over
   1,755 assemblages. To place assemblages in a multivariate evolutionary
   composition space, we used a phylogenetically informed ordination
   analysis, and to determine what the main phylogenetic groups of
   assemblages were, we used K-means clustering based on phylogenetic
   dissimilarity of assemblages. To quantify how well environmental
   variables distinguish the phylogenetic groups found, we implemented
   classification tree approaches. Then, to explore the evolutionary
   turnover between the phylogenetic groups, we calculated phylogenetic
   beta diversity. Finally, we determined the lineages that are most
   strongly associated with individual phylogenetic groups using an
   indicator analysis for lineages.
   Results Our analyses suggest that there are seven principal groups, in
   terms of evolutionary lineage composition, in the Atlantic Forest. The
   greatest turnover of phylogenetic lineage composition separates tropical
   evergreen rain forest and semideciduous assemblages from subtropical and
   highland assemblages. The mixed subtropical forest showed the lowest
   phylogenetic compositional similarity values with other groups. Tropical
   rain forest had the highest number of significant indicator lineages,
   and the highest values of the indicator statistic for lineages.
   Main conclusions We found that the most pronounced evolutionary division
   separates southern and highland tree assemblages from those occurring
   under more tropical climates and at lower elevations. Our phylogenetic
   analyses point to an environmentally driven compositional division,
   likely based on the regular occurrence of freezing versus non-freezing
   temperatures. Precipitation and edaphic regimes that assemblages
   experience had less definitive effects on their evolutionary lineage
   composition.},

Abstract = {Aim Electronic distribution atlases and lists of ecological indicator
   values are becoming important tools in plant geography. In this
   contribution, we combine a geographical and an ecological data bank, and
   map out patterns of indicator value spectra ( instead of single or
   average values) across a physiographically complex landscape. For our
   study, we select indicators of soil pH and carbonate content as key
   environmental factors that strongly affect overall plant diversity
   patterns in the temperate zone. Our goal is to relate the distribution
   and diversity of plant groups that are indicators of soil pH and
   carbonate content to environmental controls at the landscape-scale, and
   thus contribute to a causal understanding of species pools.
   Location We studied the Bavarian Alps, which represent the German
   portion of the Northern Alps.
   Methods Based on the existing floristic survey, we calculated relative
   frequencies of nine classes of indicator plants for soil pH and
   carbonate content in grid cells. The resulting attribute matrix ( cells
   by indicator class frequencies) was subjected to principal components
   analysis and to k-means clustering. Results were compared and mapped out
   in the grid array of the whole region, resulting in continuous and
   discrete representations of species pool structure. We used a
   geographical information system to derive physiographical landscape
   properties from a geological map and a digital elevation model, and
   analysed their statistical relationship with the shapes of indicator
   spectra.
   Results and Main conclusions Averages of indicator values for soil pH
   and carbonate content follow the geological structure quite closely.
   Surprisingly, the diversity of indicator plant groups does not appear to
   be a function of geological or topographic heterogeneity. Rather, it
   seems to be related to areas of high elevation with uniform geology. The
   effect is a matter of additional acidophytes in high mountain areas and,
   in the high calcareous Alps, extreme calciphytes, while species with
   intermediate requirements are rarer than usual. For explanation, we
   suggest two facts: ( 1) a frequent lack of mature soils at high
   elevations and ( 2) particularities in soil genetic processes occurring
   under the harsh climatic conditions of high mountains.},

Abstract = {P> Species assemblages of diatoms, rotifers, chydorids, planktonic
   crustaceans and chironomids were studied in 235 alpine lakes in the
   Alps, Pyrenees, Tatras (Western Carpathians), Retezat (Southern
   Carpathians) and Rila Mountains (Balkans).
   For all taxonomic groups we found a hierarchical structure in the
   community assemblage using distinct scales of lake clustering (number of
   k-means groups) based on species composition similarity (Hellinger
   distance). We determined the optimal partition in assemblage types (i.e.
   number of lake clusters) for each taxonomic group by maximising the sum
   of the taxon indicative value (IndVal) and performed discriminant
   analyses, using environmental variables not conditioned by geographical
   patterns. Relevant environmental variables differed among and within
   taxonomic groups. Therefore the assemblages respond to a complex
   environmental mosaic, with the exception of diatom assemblages, which
   followed an acid-base gradient.
   The significant environmental variables could be grouped into four
   general factors: lake size, tropho-dynamic status, acid-base balance and
   ice-cover duration (i.e., altitudinal gradient). Lake size was
   significant for the highest number of assemblage types; however, the
   most significant factor differed among taxonomic groups: acid-base
   balance for diatoms, lake size for rotifers, ice-cover duration for
   chydorids and planktonic crustaceans and tropho-dynamic status for
   chironomids. No single environmental typology accounted for the
   assemblage structure of all taxonomic groups.
   However, defining ecological thresholds as values within environmental
   gradients at which the rate of change in assemblages is accelerated
   relative to points distant from that threshold, we were able to find
   specific threshold values for each of the four main general
   environmental factors identified, which were relevant across several
   taxonomic groups: 3 ha for lake area; 0.6 mg L-1 for dissolved organic
   carbon; 190 days for ice-cover duration and 200 mu eq L-1 for acid
   neutralising capacity. Above and below these values ecosystem
   organisation change substantially. They have direct applications in
   establishing lake typologies for environmental quality and biodiversity
   conservation programmes, and in improving predictions about global
   change impacts.},

Abstract = {Aim: Forest-steppe complexes in the peri-Carpathian region harbour
   specific vegetation dominated by tall herbs. Our aim was to provide new
   phytosociological data on this vegetation type from the Ukraine and
   adjacent parts of Romania, compare it with previously published data,
   discuss its position in broad ecological and biogeographical context and
   suggest its syntaxonomic treatment respecting both its physiognomy and
   species composition. Study area: Western Ukraine and Romania. Methods:
   We assembled a dataset of 711 relev??s of thermophilous herb-rich
   vegetation (Trifolio-Geranietea) from the study area and adjacent
   regions of Eastern Poland and Slovakia using own field research,
   literature survey and large databases. Using intersection of three
   different classification algorithms (beta-flexible, modified TWINSPAN
   and K-means clustering) we identified a consensus delimitation of the
   vegetation type. NMDS ordination, analysis of diagnostic, constant and
   dominant species, and Didukh indicator values were used to characterize
   its species composition and habitat conditions. Results: Altogether 58
   relev??s from Western Ukraine and Romania were classified to a tall herb
   -dominated vegetation type that we identified with the association
   Trollio-Clematidetum recti T??uber et Weber 1976 described from Romania.
   We assigned it to the alliance Geranion sanguinei. It differs from other
   communities of this alliance in its preference for shady slopes, greater
   stand height and considerable representation of mesophilous and montane
   species. It is confined to calcareous bedrock with high soil pH and high
   mineral richness. Conclusions: We suggest that the studied tall
   herb-dominated vegetation is a specific steppe type, confined to
   relatively moist and nutrient rich sites in the peri-Carpathian area.
   Analogous vegetation occurs in the Alps, Balkans, hemiboreal Europe,
   South Urals and Western Siberia. Its species composition and
   biogeographical relationships provide further support for the hypothesis
   that steppe meadows of Central Europe, including tall herb-dominated
   stands, are linked to the Pleistocene and early-Holocene forest-steppe
   of temperate Eurasia.},

Title = {Vascular plant compositional gradients within and between Iowa fens},

Volume = {15},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Question: What is the nature and relative importance of compositional
   gradients within- and between fens?
   Location: Iowa, USA.
   Methods: 506 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats were sampled from 31 fens across a
   550 km extent. Presence/absence of all vascular plant taxa, plus the
   non-vascular genera Sphagnum and Chara, and values for 24 environmental
   variables were noted. Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling and
   Monte Carlo tests were used to describe compositional variation and
   identify significant environmental co-variables. Model-based cluster
   analysis was used to identify the optimal number of groups supported by
   the data, while k-means clustering was used to assign each quadrat to a
   group. The number of occurrences (and frequency) of each species within
   each group was calculated. Two-dimensional 95\% Gaussian confidence
   intervals, ANOVA, correlation coefficient homogeneity tests, log-linear
   modelling, and Fisher's exact tests were used to document patterns of
   compositional change.
   Results: Two stable axes of variation were identified: the first being
   most closely correlated with soil pH, Mg, Ca, P, S, vegetation height,
   surface and -10 cm soil temperature, site area, perimeter,
   perimeter/area ratio, growing season, and air temperature, with the
   second being most correlated to soil moisture, N, disturbance level, \%
   organic matter, hummock height, N-S coordinate, and precipitation.
   Individual sites harboured between 20-47\% of total compositional
   variation, with 28\% of Axis 1 and 55\% of Axis 2 scores being contained
   within-sites. Five compositional regions were identified that differed
   in the proportion of calciphile and hydrophile species. Compositional
   groups differed significantly between geologic types.
   Conclusions: While the principal axis of variation (corresponding to the
   rich-poor fen gradient) is present largely between sites, the second
   axis (corresponding to water level) is largely repeated within sites.
   Documentation and protection of vegetation patterns and species
   diversity within Iowa fens will thus require consideration of multiple
   sites across the landscape.},

Title = {Comparison of discrete and continuum community models: Insights from
   numerical ecology and Bayesian methods applied to Azorean plant
   communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {402},
Pages = {93-106},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Our view of community ecology has evolved over time, beginning with two
   extreme visions of plant communities which were considered either as
   species associations driven by random coincidences or as complex
   organisms with clear interdependencies. More recently, biological
   communities tend to be viewed as a set of local community assemblages
   that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species
   (i.e., a meta-community), a concept that has been used to explain
   spatiotemporal dynamics. Several models have been proposed to explain
   the distribution patterns of species and communities along environmental
   gradients, ranging from discrete, individual community types, to a
   continuum of plant communities. The Azorean natural vegetation is a good
   study model to test those hypotheses, since it has been described in
   detail by several authors, therefore creating the opportunity to address
   theoretical questions within a conceptual metacommunity framework,
   Through a combination of numerical ecology and Bayesian analysis applied
   to natural forest community data from the Azores archipelago, the
   present study evaluated if the present data supports the existence of
   ``discrete community types{''} or of a ``continuum of communities{''}.
   We used hierarchical clustering (Hellinger distance and UPGMA) and
   non-hierarchical clustering (k-means clustering), as well as a
   multinomial model in a Bayesian context to determine the number of plant
   community groups. A total of 139 plant communities and 85 species were
   sampled in four islands. The optimum number of plant community groups
   ranged from 4 to 6 for hierarchical clustering, and neared 43 for
   non-hierarchical clustering and about 70 for the multinomial analysis.
   The elevation distribution curves estimated suggest that species
   distributions are determined by physiological limits at the extremes,
   and by competition under intermediate conditions, with some niche
   partitioning between dominant species. Our results would be in agreement
   with an ecological view of the communities as a continuum, more than
   with a view considering the existence of discrete community types.},

Title = {Capturing shell-crushing by large mobile predators using passive
   acoustics technology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {535},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Dumphagy (shell-crushing) is a predatory mode that has evolved across
   numerous marine taxa from relatively sessile crustaceans to large and
   highly mobile fishes and mammals. Despite its preponderance in the
   marine environment, the ecology of dumphagy (i.e., dynamics and
   spatiotemporal distribution) remains poorly understood especially for
   highly mobile species, limiting our ability to quantify their predatory
   effects on benthic communities. Here, we used passive acoustics (i.e.,
   remote monitoring of underwater sounds with acoustic recorders) to
   characterize consumption of hard-shelled mollusk prey by a model
   predator, the whitespotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari). Acoustic
   recordings were made in captivity for 434 total prey items, spanning
   eight species of hard-shelled mollusks (1 bivalve, 7 gastropods). For
   all prey types, consumption sequences were generally characterized by an
   initial high-energy signal (Sound Pressure Level > 160 dB re 1 mu Pa),
   presumably associated with shell failure, followed by numerous
   additional signals of lesser energy as prey was further fractured and
   winnowed by the predator. Fracture events were short-lived (<0.1 s) with
   peak frequencies ranging from 3.1 to 5.0 kHz, depending on prey type.
   Statistical analyses showed capacity to distinguish between the two
   dominant prey types offered (hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria and banded
   tulip, Cinctura lilium) based on processing time, the number of
   fractures, as well as using a suite of energy and spectral features
   associated with these acoustic signals. Importantly, we noted that the
   directionality of these relationships (i.e., relative differences in
   signals between prey types) can change depending on the chronological
   location within a consumption sequence and the amount of data analyzed
   (e.g., first fracture event vs. all fracture event), which may present
   analytical challenges. Additionally, in situ simulation of fracture
   events in the target environment suggested events could be detected
   above ambient noise out to 100 s of m. To our knowledge, this is the
   first attempt to both quantify and classify durophagy using passive
   acoustics. We recommend that future studies conduct extensive testing in
   controlled and target environments to build robust data sets capable of
   supporting feature extraction as well as detection-classification
   schemes via machine-learning. Lastly, collaborations with biomechanical
   scientists are suggested to facilitate a better understanding of the
   mechanisms driving acoustic variation of shell fracture across prey

Title = {Automated acoustic monitoring captures timing and intensity of bird
   migration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Monitoring small, mobile organisms is crucial for science and
   conservation, but is technically challenging. Migratory birds are prime
   examples, often undertaking nocturnal movements of thousands of
   kilometres over inaccessible and inhospitable geography. Acoustic
   technology could facilitate widespread monitoring of nocturnal bird
   migration with minimal human effort. Acoustics complements existing
   monitoring methods by providing information about individual behaviour
   and species identities, something generally not possible with tools such
   as radar. However, the need for expert humans to review audio and
   identify vocalizations is a challenge to application and development of
   acoustic technologies. Here, we describe an automated acoustic
   monitoring pipeline that combines acoustic sensors with machine
   listening software (BirdVoxDetect). We monitor 4 months of autumn
   migration in the northeastern United States with five acoustic sensors,
   extracting nightly estimates of nocturnal calling activity of 14
   migratory species with distinctive flight calls. We examine the ability
   of acoustics to inform two important facets of bird migration: (1) the
   quantity of migrating birds aloft and (2) the migration timing of
   individual species. We validate these data with contemporaneous
   observations from Doppler radars and a large community of citizen
   scientists, from which we derive independent measures of migration
   passage and timing. Together, acoustic and weather data produced
   accurate estimates of the number of actively migrating birds detected
   with radar. A model combining acoustic data, weather and seasonal timing
   explained 75\% of variation in radar-derived migration intensity. This
   model outperformed models that lacked acoustic data. Including acoustics
   in the model decreased prediction error by 33\%. A model with only
   acoustic information outperformed a model comprising weather and date
   (57\% vs. 48\% variation explained, respectively). Acoustics also
   successfully measured migration phenology: species-specific timing
   estimated by acoustic sensors explained 71\% of variation in timing
   derived from citizen science observations. Synthesis and applications.
   Our results demonstrate that cost-effective acoustic sensors can monitor
   bird migration at species resolution at the landscape scale and should
   be an integral part of management toolkits. Acoustic monitoring presents
   distinct advantages over radar and human observation, especially in
   inaccessible and inhospitable locations, and requires significantly less
   expense. Managers should consider using acoustic tools for monitoring
   avian movements and identifying and understanding dangerous situations
   for birds. These recommendations apply to a variety of conservation and
   policy applications, including mitigating the impacts of light
   pollution, siting energy infrastructure (e.g. wind turbines) and
   reducing collisions with structures and aircraft.},

Title = {Machine learned daily life history classification using low frequency
   tracking data and automated modelling pipelines: application to North
   American waterfowl},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Background Identifying animal behaviors, life history states, and
   movement patterns is a prerequisite for many animal behavior analyses
   and effective management of wildlife and habitats. Most approaches
   classify short-term movement patterns with high frequency location or
   accelerometry data. However, patterns reflecting life history across
   longer time scales can have greater relevance to species biology or
   management needs, especially when available in near real-time. Given
   limitations in collecting and using such data to accurately classify
   complex behaviors in the long-term, we used hourly GPS data from 5
   waterfowl species to produce daily activity classifications with
   machine-learned models using ``automated modelling pipelines{''}.
   Methods Automated pipelines are computer-generated code that complete
   many tasks including feature engineering, multi-framework model
   development, training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning to produce
   daily classifications from eight activity patterns reflecting waterfowl
   life history or movement states. We developed several input features for
   modeling grouped into three broad categories, hereafter ``feature
   sets{''}: GPS locations, habitat information, and movement history. Each
   feature set used different data sources or data collected across
   different time intervals to develop the ``features{''} (independent
   variables) used in models. Results Automated modelling pipelines rapidly
   developed easily reproducible data preprocessing and analysis steps,
   identification and optimization of the best performing model and
   provided outputs for interpreting feature importance. Unequal expression
   of life history states caused unbalanced classes, so we evaluated
   feature set importance using a weighted F1-score to balance model recall
   and precision among individual classes. Although the best model using
   the least restrictive feature set (only 24 hourly relocations in a day)
   produced effective classifications (weighted F1 = 0.887), models using
   all feature sets performed substantially better (weighted F1 = 0.95),
   particularly for rarer but demographically more impactful life history
   states (i.e., nesting). Conclusions Automated pipelines generated models
   producing highly accurate classifications of complex daily activity
   patterns using relatively low frequency GPS and incorporating more
   classes than previous GPS studies. Near real-time classification is
   possible which is ideal for time-sensitive needs such as identifying
   reproduction. Including habitat and longer sequences of spatial
   information produced more accurate classifications but incurred slight
   delays in processing.},

Title = {Drivers of fire severity shift as landscapes transition to an active
   fire regime, Klamath Mountains, USA},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fire severity patterns are driven by interactions between fire,
   vegetation, and terrain, and they generate legacy effects that influence
   future fire severity. A century of fire exclusion and fuel buildup has
   eroded legacy effects, and contemporary fire severity patterns may
   diverge from historical patterns. In recent decades, area burned and
   area burned at high severity have increased and landscapes are
   transitioning back to an active fire regime where disturbance legacies
   will again play a strong role in determining fire severity.
   Understanding the drivers of fire severity is crucial for anticipating
   future fire severity patterns as active fire regimes are reestablished.
   We identified drivers of fire severity in the Klamath Mountains, a
   landscape with an active fire regime, using two machine learning
   statistical models: one model for non-reburns (n = 92) and one model for
   reburns (n = 61). Both models predicted low better than moderate or
   high-severity fire. Fire severity drivers contrasted sharply between
   non-reburns and reburns. Fire weather and fuels were dominant controls
   in non-reburns, while previous burn severity, fuel characteristics, and
   time since last fire were drivers for reburns. In reburns, areas
   initially burned at low (high) severity burned the same way again. This
   tendency was sufficiently strong that reburn fire severity could be
   predicted equally well with only severity of the previous fire in the
   model. Thus, reburn fire severity is more predictable than severity in
   non-reburns that are driven by the stochastic influences of fire
   weather. Reburn severity in aggregate was also higher than non-reburn
   severity suggesting a positive feedback effect that could contribute to
   an upward drift in fire severity as area burned increases. Terrain had
   low importance in both models. This indicates strong terrain controls in
   the past may not carry into the future. Low- and moderate-severity fire
   effects were prevalent in non-reburns under moderate fire weather and
   self-reinforcing behavior maintained these effects in reburns even under
   more extreme weather, particularly in reburns within 10 yr. Our findings
   suggest deliberate use of wildfire and prescribed fire under moderate
   conditions would increase fire resilience in landscapes transitioning to
   an active fire regime.},

Title = {Using Ecological Niche Models for Population and Range Estimates of a
   Threatened Snake Species (Crotalus oreganus) in Canada},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Modelling the distribution and abundance of species at risk is extremely
   important for their conservation and management. We used ecological
   niche models (ENMs) to predict the occurrence of western rattlesnakes
   (Crotalus oreganus) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. We applied this to
   existing population estimates to support a threshold of occurrence for
   management and conservation. We also identified predictors influencing
   rattlesnake distribution and abundance in this region. Using a
   Geographic Information Systems platform, we incorporated ENMs,
   capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and radio-telemetry results, province-wide
   observations, Landsat imagery and provincial databases for agricultural
   land use to produce quantitative, spatially explicit, population
   estimates across BC. Using available western rattlesnake habitat
   estimated at 183.9 km(2) and averaging estimates calculated from
   densities in three study populations, we generated a mean adult
   population size of 9722 (\& PLUSMN;SD 3009; 0.8 relative index of
   occurrence {[}RIO] threshold). Only a small area (21.6 km(2)) of
   suitable land cover was located within protected areas, potentially
   protecting an estimated 1144 (\& PLUSMN;354) adults. Most suitable land
   cover was within 500 m of roads (170.6 km(2)), representing potential
   habitat being used by an estimated 9017 (\& PLUSMN;2791) adults. At the
   threshold RIO value chosen (0.8), only a very small area of farmland
   provided suitable land cover. Our results highlight the possibility of
   high mortality rates for western rattlesnakes near roads and the fact
   that protected areas do not provide sufficient coverage to conserve the
   population. Given that this species has relatively low mobility and high
   site fidelity to home ranges, our population estimate for BC provides a
   useful reference for the northern part of the species' range. It also
   fulfills a need to estimate population size within political
   jurisdictions where conservation management decisions are made, as well
   as presenting a method that can be applied to other parts of the range,
   including the southern United States. Our study provides an important
   benchmark for future monitoring of western rattlesnakes in BC using a
   repeatable and transparent approach. Similar applications can be
   extrapolated and applied for other threatened species to identify and
   quantify population distributions and threats, further supporting
   conservation prioritization tools to be used to maximize the
   effectiveness of conservation strategies under financial
   constraints.</p>},

Title = {Chemistry of floral rewards: intra- and interspecific variability of
   nectar and pollen secondary metabolites across taxa},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Floral chemistry mediates plant interactions with pollinators,
   pathogens, and herbivores, with major consequences for fitness of both
   plants and flower visitors. The outcome of such interactions often
   depends on compound dose and chemical context. However, chemical
   diversity and intraspecific variation of nectar and pollen secondary
   chemistry are known for very few species, precluding general statements
   about their composition. We analyzed methanol extracts of flowers,
   nectar, and pollen from 31 cultivated and wild plant species, including
   multiple sites and cultivars, by
   liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. To depict the chemical niche of
   each tissue type, we analyzed differences in nectar and pollen chemical
   richness, absolute and proportional concentrations, and intraspecific
   variability. We hypothesized that pollen would have higher
   concentrations and more compounds than nectar, consistent with Optimal
   Defense Theory and pollen's importance as a male gamete. To investigate
   chemical correlations across and within tissues, which could reflect
   physiological constraints, we quantified chemical overlap between
   conspecific nectar and pollen, and phenotypic integration of individual
   compounds within tissue types. Nectar and pollen were chemically
   differentiated both across and within species. Of 102 compounds
   identified, most occurred in only one species. Machine-learning
   algorithms assigned samples to the correct species and tissue type with
   98.6\% accuracy. Consistent with our hypothesis, pollen had 23.8- to
   235-fold higher secondary chemical concentrations and 63\% higher
   chemical richness than nectar. The most common secondary compound
   classes were flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenolics (primarily
   phenylpropanoids including chlorogenic acid). The most common specific
   compound types were quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, known to
   mediate biotic and abiotic effects. Pollens were distinguished from
   nectar by high concentrations of hydroxycinnamoyl-spermidine conjugates,
   which affect plant development, abiotic stress tolerance, and herbivore
   resistance. Although chemistry was qualitatively consistent within
   species and tissue types, concentrations varied across cultivars and
   sites, which could influence pollination, herbivory, and disease in wild
   and agricultural plants. Analyses of multivariate trait space showed
   greater overlap across sites and cultivars in nectar than pollen
   chemistry; this overlap reflected greater within-site and
   within-cultivar variability of nectar. Our analyses suggest different
   ecological roles of nectar and pollen mediated by chemical
   concentration, composition, and variability.},

Title = {Classification of semi-natural mesic grasslands in the Ukrainian

Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {257-293},

Abstract = {Aims and study area: We present the first formalised large-scale
   syntaxonomic overview of mesic semi-natural grassland communities
   (Arrhenatheretalia elatioris and Nardetalia strictae) in the Ukrainian
   part of the Eastern Carpathians and adjacent areas of Hungary, Slovakia
   and Poland. Methods: During 2009-2014 we recorded 759 phytosociological
   releves using the Braun-Blanquet approach. The classification was based
   on our own phytosociological material as well as published material
   recorded by both Braun-Blanquet and eco-phytocenotic (dominant) approach
   comprising 2,000 phytocoenological releves in total (952 releves in the
   stratified data set). Semi-supervised and supervised classifications by
   the K-means method and indirect gradient analysis by detrended
   correspondence analysis were used for the analyses. Slovak electronic
   expert system and diagnostic species for grassland vegetation published
   in national overviews in the neighbouring countries helped us to
   identify individual clusters. Didukh indicator values were used to
   compare habitat conditions of delimited plant communites. Results: A
   total of fifteen well-differentiated associations within five alliances
   and two classes were delimited: Class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea including
   the alliance Arrhenatherion elatioris with associations Anthoxantho
   odorati-Agrostietum tenuis, Betonico officinalis-Trifolietum pannonici,
   Poo-Trisetetum flavescentis, Primulo veris-Agrostietum capillaris and
   Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris and the alliance Cynosurion
   cristati with associations Plantagini-Lolietum perennis and Lolio
   perennis-Cynosuretum cristati. Class Nardetea strictae including the
   alliance Nardo strictae-Agrostion tenuis with associations Antennario
   dioicaeNardetum strictae, Campanulo abietinae-Nardetum strictae and
   Betonico officinalis-Agrostietum capillaris, the alliance Violion
   caninae with associations Campanulo rotundifoliae-Dianthetum deltoidis,
   Hyperico maculatiDeschampsietum flexuosae, Festuco rupicolae-Nardetum
   strictae and Polygalo vulgaris-Nardetum strictae caricetosum fuscae and
   the alliance Potentillo ternatae-Nardion strictae with association
   Soldanello hungaricaeNardetum strictae. The ecological differentiation
   of syntaxa is mainly based on certain environmental factors reflected in
   Didukh indicator values (DIV), management practices and altitude.
   Conclusions: This study complements current knowledge about mesic
   grasslands from poorly sampled area using the Braun-Blanquet approach.
   The classified syntaxa of mesic grasslands are discussed with respect to
   their distribution in the Carpathians and Europe and we expect that the
   results of our research will assist in the anticipated future
   supranational classification of mesic grasslands in the Carpathians.},

Title = {Classifying development stages of primeval European beech forests: is
   clustering a useful tool?},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {BackgroundOld-growth and primeval forests are passing through a natural
   development cycle with recurring stages of forest development. Several
   methods for assigning patches of different structure and size to forest
   development stages or phases do exist. All currently existing
   classification methods have in common that a priori assumptions about
   the characteristics of certain stand structural attributes such as
   deadwood amount are made. We tested the hypothesis that multivariate
   datasets of primeval beech forest stand structure possess an inherent,
   aggregated configuration of data points with individual clusters
   representing forest development stages. From two completely mapped
   primeval beech forests in Albania, seven ecologically important stand
   structural attributes characterizing stand density, regeneration, stem
   diameter variation and amount of deadwood are derived at 8216 and 9666
   virtual sampling points (moving window, focal filtering). K-means
   clustering is used to detect clusters in the datasets (number of
   clusters (k) between 2 and 5). The quality of the single clustering
   solutions is analyzed with average silhouette width as a measure for
   clustering quality. In a sensitivity analysis, clustering is done with
   datasets of four different spatial scales of observation (200, 500, 1000
   and 1500m(2), circular virtual plot area around sampling points) and
   with two different kernels (equal weighting of all objects within a plot
   vs. weighting by distance to the virtual plot center).ResultsThe
   clustering solutions succeeded in detecting and mapping areas with
   homogeneous stand structure. The areas had extensions of more than
   200m(2), but differences between clusters were very small with average
   silhouette widths of less than 0.28. The obtained datasets had a
   homogeneous configuration with only very weak trends for
   clustering.ConclusionsOur results imply that forest development takes
   place on a continuous scale and that discrimination between development
   stages in primeval beech forests is splitting continuous datasets at
   selected thresholds. For the analysis of the forest development cycle,
   direct quantification of relevant structural features or processes might
   be more appropriate than classification. If, however, the study design
   demands classification, our results can justify the application of
   conventional forest development stage classification schemes rather than
   clustering.},

Title = {RCLUS, a new program for clustering associated species: A demonstration
   using a Mojave desert plant community dataset},
Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-297},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper presents a new clustering program named RCLUS that was
   developed for species (R-mode) analysis of plant community data. RCLUS
   identifies clusters of co-occurring species that meet a user-specified
   cutoff level of positive association with each other. The ``strict
   affinity{''} clustering algorithm in RCLUS builds clusters of species
   whose pairwise associations all exceed the cutoff level, whereas the
   ``coalition{''} clustering algorithm only requires that the mean
   pairwise association of the cluster exceeds the cutoff level. Both
   algorithms allow species to belong to multiple clusters, thus
   accommodating both generalist and specialist species. Using a 60-plot
   dataset of perennial plants occurring on the Beaver Dam Slope in
   southwestern Utah, we carried out RCLUS analyses and compared the
   results with 2 widely used clustering techniques: UPGMA and PAM. We
   found that many of the RCLUS clusters were subsets of the UPGMA and PAM
   clusters, although novel species combinations were also generated by
   RCLUS. An advantage of RCLUS over these methods is its ability to
   exclude species that are poorly represented in a dataset as well as
   species lacking strong association patterns. The RCLUS program also
   includes modules that assess the affinity of a given species, plot, or
   environmental variable to a given cluster. We found statistically
   significant correlations between some of the RCLUS species clusters and
   certain environmental variables of the study area (elevation and
   topographical position). We also noted differences in clustering
   behavior when different association coefficients were used in RCLUS and
   found that those incorporating joint absences (e.g., the phi
   coefficient) produced more clusters and more even numbers of species per
   cluster than those not incorporating joint absences (e.g., the Jaccard
   index). In addition to the species association application described in
   this paper, the RCLUS algorithms could be used for preliminary data
   stratification in sample (Q-mode) analysis. The indirect link between
   sample plots and RCLUS species clusters could also be exploited to yield
   a form of ``fuzzy{''} classification of plots or to characterize species
   pools of plots.},

Title = {Historical and current landscape-scale ponderosa pine and mixed conifer
   forest structure in the Southern Sierra Nevada},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many managers today are tasked with restoring forests to mitigate the
   potential for uncharacteristically severe fire. One challenge to this
   mandate is the lack of large-scale reference information on forest
   structure prior to impacts from Euro-American settlement. We used a
   robust 1911 historical dataset that covers a large geographic extent
   (>10,000 ha) and has unbiased sampling locations to compare past and
   current forest conditions for ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests
   in the southern Sierra Nevada. The 1911 dataset contained records from
   18,052 trees in 378 sampled transects, totaling just over 300 ha in
   transect area. Forest structure was highly variable in 1911 and shrubs
   were found in 54\% of transects. Total tree basal area ranged from 1 to
   60 m(2) ha(-1) and tree density from 2 to 170 ha(-1) (based on trees >30
   cm dbh). K-means cluster analysis divided transects into four groups:
   mixed conifer-high basal area (MC High BA), mixed conifer-average basal
   area (MC Ave BA), mixed conifer-average basal area-high shrubs (MC Ave
   BA Shrubs), and ponderosa pine (Pond Pine). The percentage of this 1911
   landscape that experienced high severity fire was low and varied from
   1-3\% in mixed conifer forests and 4-6\% in ponderosa pine forests.
   Comparing forest inventory data from 1911 to the present indicates that
   current forests have changed drastically, particularly in tree density,
   canopy cover, the density of large trees, dominance of white fir in
   mixed conifer forests, and the similarity of tree basal area in
   contemporary ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests. Average forest
   canopy cover increased from 25-49\% in mixed conifer forests, and from
   12-49\% in ponderosa pine forests from 1911 to the present; canopy cover
   in current forest types is similar but in 1911 mixed conifer forests had
   twice the canopy cover as ponderosa pine forests. Current forest
   restoration goals in the southern Sierra Nevada are often skewed toward
   the higher range of these historical values, which will limit the
   effectiveness of these treatments if the objective is to produce
   resilient forest ecosystems into the future.},

Title = {Vegetation diversity of mesic grasslands (Arrhenatheretalia) in the
   Iberian Peninsula},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {QuestionsWhat is the diversity and main vegetation types in mesic
   grasslands on the Iberian Peninsula? What are the main diagnostic
   species of each type? What are the main environmental gradients that
   drive patterns of species composition? To what extent does biogeography
   influence community diversity?
   LocationIberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain, including the French
   Pyrenees).
   MethodsFormal definitions based on the Cocktail method were used to
   establish a typology of mesic grasslands of the Arrhenatheretalia order.
   This method was applied to a stratified data set of 3485 releves, also
   including other types of perennial grassland. Semi-supervised
   classification based on the K-means algorithm was used to assign almost
   757 releves into the vegetation types defined by Cocktail and to
   identify new ones. The types were compared by means of detrended
   correspondence analysis (DCA) using climate data, altitude and Ellenberg
   indicator values as explanatory variables.
   ResultsFourteen ecologically well-defined associations were
   distinguished in the Arrhenatheretalia order: five in the Arrhenatherion
   alliance, two in Triseto-Polygonion and seven in Cynosurion. Soil
   reaction, summer aridity and altitude were identified as the most
   important determinants of species composition. These lithological and
   bioclimatic gradients are related to the biogeographic diversity of the
   study area, which is the main driver of community diversity in
   Arrhenatheretalia grasslands; it is more important than the management
   practices expressed in the concept of alliances. The classification and
   ordination analyses also showed a clear differentiation in community
   diversity according to biogeographic sectors (eastern
   Cantabrian-Atlantic, Galician-Portuguese, Carpetan-Leonese, Pyrenean,
   Orocantabrian/western Pyrenean and Oroiberian/Catalan-Valencian). In
   addition, moisture and nutrient content were more important than
   altitude in differentiating Arrhenatherion and Triseto-Polygonion
   communities in the Pyrenees.
   ConclusionsWe suggest a simplification of the traditional classification
   of the Iberian Arrhenatheretalia grasslands. For this revised
   classification, we propose an electronic expert system with consistent
   rules for assigning vegetation observations to the associations defined,
   and a list of the diagnostic species of each vegetation type. These
   results can be applied to identify and monitor the hay meadows included
   in Annex I of the European Habitats Directive, taking into account the
   biogeographic context of the indicator species.},

Title = {Analytical approaches for evaluating passive acoustic monitoring data: A
   case study of avian vocalizations},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The interface between field biology and technology is energizing the
   collection of vast quantities of environmental data. Passive acoustic
   monitoring, the use of unattended recording devices to capture
   environmental sound, is an example where technological advances have
   facilitated an influx of data that routinely exceeds the capacity for
   analysis. Computational advances, particularly the integration of
   machine learning approaches, will support data extraction efforts.
   However, the analysis and interpretation of these data will require
   parallel growth in conceptual and technical approaches for data
   analysis. Here, we use a large hand-annotated dataset to showcase
   analysis approaches that will become increasingly useful as datasets
   grow and data extraction can be partially automated. We propose and
   demonstrate seven technical approaches for analyzing bioacoustic data.
   These include the following: (1) generating species lists and
   descriptions of vocal variation, (2) assessing how abiotic factors
   (e.g., rain and wind) impact vocalization rates, (3) testing for
   differences in community vocalization activity across sites and habitat
   types, (4) quantifying the phenology of vocal activity, (5) testing for
   spatiotemporal correlations in vocalizations within species, (6) among
   species, and (7) using rarefaction analysis to quantify diversity and
   optimize bioacoustic sampling. To demonstrate these approaches, we
   sampled in 2016 and 2018 and used hand annotations of 129,866 bird
   vocalizations from two forests in New Hampshire, USA, including sites in
   the Hubbard Brook Experiment Forest where bioacoustic data could be
   integrated with more than 50 years of observer-based avian studies.
   Acoustic monitoring revealed differences in community patterns in
   vocalization activity between forests of different ages, as well as
   between nearby similar watersheds. Of numerous environmental variables
   that were evaluated, background noise was most clearly related to
   vocalization rates. The songbird community included one cluster of
   species where vocalization rates declined as ambient noise increased and
   another cluster where vocalization rates declined over the nesting
   season. In some common species, the number of vocalizations produced per
   day was correlated at scales of up to 15 km. Rarefaction analyses showed
   that adding sampling sites increased species detections more than adding
   sampling days. Although our analyses used hand-annotated data, the
   methods will extend readily to large-scale automated detection of
   vocalization events. Such data are likely to become increasingly
   available as autonomous recording units become more advanced,
   affordable, and power efficient. Passive acoustic monitoring with human
   or automated identification at the species level offers growing
   potential to complement observer-based studies of avian ecology.},

Abstract = {Ecological networks are powerful tools for visualizing biodiversity data
   and assessing ecosystem health and function. Constructing these networks
   requires considerable empirical efforts, and this remains highly
   challenging due to sampling limitations and the laborious and
   notoriously limited, error-prone process of traditional taxonomic
   identification. Recent advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing
   and high-performance computing provide new ways to address these
   challenges. DNA metabarcoding, a method of bulk taxonomic identification
   from DNA extracted from environmental samples, can generate detailed
   biodiversity information through a standardizable analytical pipeline
   for species detection. When this biodiversity information is annotated
   with prior knowledge on taxon interactions, body size, and trophic
   position, it is possible to generate trait-based networks, which we call
   ``heuristic food webs{''}. Although curating trait matrices for
   constructing heuristic food webs is a laborious, often intractable
   process using manual literature surveys, it can be greatly accelerated
   via text mining, allowing knowledge of relevant traits to be gathered
   across large databases. To explore this possibility, we employed a
   General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) system to create a
   hybrid text-mining pipeline combining rule-based and machine-learning
   modules. This pipeline was then used to query online repositories of
   published papers for missing data on a key trait, body size, that could
   not be gathered from existing trophic link libraries of freshwater
   benthic macroinvertebrates. Combining text-mined body size information
   with feeding information from existing sources allowed us to generate a
   database of over 20,000 pairwise trophic interactions. Next, we
   developed a pipeline that uses taxa lists generated from DNA
   metabarcoding and annotates this matrix with trophic information from
   existing databases and text-mined body size data. In this way, we
   generated heuristic food webs for wetland sites within a large delta
   complex formed by the confluence of the Peace and Athabasca rivers in
   northern Alberta: the Peace Athabasca delta. Finally, we used these
   putative food webs and their network properties to resolve spatial and
   temporal differences between the benthic subwebs of wetlands in the
   Peace and Athabasca sectors of the delta complex. Specifically, we asked
   two questions. (1) How do food web properties (e.g. number of links,
   linkage density, trophic height) differ between the wetlands of the
   Peace and Athabasca deltas? (2) How do food web properties change
   temporally in wetlands of the two deltas? We discuss using
   DNA-generated, trait-based food webs as a powerful tool for rapid
   bioassessment, assess the limitations of our current approach, and
   outline a path forward to make this powerful tool more widely available
   for land managers and conservation biologists.},

Abstract = {Cost-effective reduction of uncertainty in global biodiversity
   indicators is a central goal of conservation. Comprising a sixth of the
   74000+ species currently on the IUCN Red List, Data Deficient species
   contribute to considerable uncertainty in estimates of extinction risk.
   Estimating levels of risk in Data Deficient species will require large
   resources given the costs of surveys and Red List assessments.
   Predicting extinction risk from species traits and geographical
   information could provide a cheaper approach for determining the
   proportion of Data Deficient species at risk of extinction. We use
   double sampling theory to compare the cost-effectiveness of predictive
   models and IUCN Red List assessments for estimating risk levels in Data
   Deficient terrestrial mammals, amphibians, reptiles and crayfish. For
   each group, we calibrate machine learning models of extinction risk on
   species of known conservation status and assess their cost and
   reliability relative to field surveys followed by Red List assessments.
   We show that regardless of model type used or species group examined, it
   is always more cost-effective to determine the conservation status of
   all species with models and assess a small proportion of species with
   IUCN criteria (double sampling), rather than spend the same resources on
   field surveys and Red List assessments alone (single sampling). We
   estimate that surveying and re-assessing all Data Deficient species
   currently listed on the IUCN Red List (12206 species) with IUCN criteria
   would cost a minimum of US \$323million. Double sampling reduces the
   cost of determining the proportion of Data Deficient species at risk of
   extinction by up to 68\%, because <6\% of Data Deficient species would
   need to be surveyed and assessed with IUCN criteria.Synthesis and
   applications. Double sampling with models cost-effectively estimates
   extinction risk levels in poorly known species and can be used to reduce
   the impact of uncertainty in the Red List and Red List Index. We provide
   recommendations for uptake by managers and a sampling planner
   spreadsheet. Double sampling could be applied more widely in ecology and
   conservation to formally compare the cost-effectiveness of sampling
   methods differing in cost and reliability.

Title = {Deriving phenology of barley with imaging hyperspectral remote sensing},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to create a model that predicts the different
   phenological BBCH macro-stages of barley in laboratory on the plot scale
   and to transfer the most suitable model to the landscape scale. To
   characterise the phenology, eight vitality and phenology-related
   vegetation parameters like leaf area index (LAI), Chl-SPAD content,
   C-content, N-content, C/N-content, canopy chlorophyll content (CCC),
   gravimetric water content (GWC) and vegetation height at the same time
   as all imaging hyperspectral measurements (AISA-EAGLE, 395-973 nm).
   These biochemical-biophysical vegetation parameters were investigated
   according to the different phenological macro-stages of barley. The
   predictive models were developed using four different types of
   vegetation indices (VI): (I) published VI's, (II) reflectance VI's as
   well as (III) VI(xy) formula combinations and (IV) a combination of all
   VI index types using the Library for Support Vector Machines (LibSVM)
   and tested with a recursive conditional correlation weighting selection
   algorithm (RCCW) to reduce the number of variables. To increase the
   performance of the model a 10-fold cross-validation was carried out for
   all statistical models. The GWC was found to be the most important
   variable for differentiating between the phenological macro-stages of
   barley. The most suitable model for predicting the phenological BBCH
   macro-stages was achieved by a model that combined all three kinds of
   VI's: published VI's, reflectance VI's and formula combination VI's with
   a classification accuracy of 84.80\%. With the classification model for
   the reflectance VI's Y = 746 nm and for the VI formula combinations Y =
   (527 + 612) nm and Y = (540 + 639) nm. The best predictive model was
   applied to the airborne AISA-EAGLE hyperspectral data to model the
   phenological macro-stages of barley at the landscape level. The
   classification error of the best predictive model of 12.80\% as well as
   disturbance factors such as channels and areas with weeds or ruderal
   vegetation lead to misclassifications of BBCH macro-stages at the
   landscape level. By using One Sensor At Different Scales-Approach
   (OSADIS), sensor-specific differences in the model building and model
   transfer can be eliminated. The approach described in the paper for
   determining the phenology based on imaging hyperspectral RS data shows
   that in the process of plant phonological development a number of
   biochemical-biophysical vegetation traits in vegetation change, which
   can be thoroughly recorded with hyperspectral remote sensing technology.
   For this reason, hyperspectral RS constitutes an ideal, cost-effective
   and comparable approach, with whose help vegetation traits and changes
   can be quantified, which are key for ecological modelling. (C) 2014

Title = {Song of my people: dialect differences among sympatric social groups of
   short-finned pilot whales in Hawai'i},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In many social species, acoustic dialects are used to differentiate
   among social groups within a local population. These acoustic dialects
   and their corresponding social groups are often related to distinct
   foraging behaviors or spatial movement patterns, and it is possible that
   vocal repertoire variability is one of the proximate mechanisms driving
   or maintaining genetic and ecological diversity at a subspecies level in
   social species. Short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorynchus)
   inhabiting Hawaiian waters have a stable hierarchical social structure,
   with familial social units associating in larger social clusters within
   island-associated communities. In this study, we test the hypothesis
   that sympatric social groups of short-finned pilot whales have
   acoustically differentiated dialects, which may be used to maintain the
   social structure. We first examined call composition of social calls
   collected from photographically identified social clusters of
   short-finned pilot whales around the Main Hawaiian Islands, using a
   catalog of manually classified calls, and found that call composition
   differed among clusters. We then conducted ANOVA and support vector
   machine (SVM) learning analyses of the acoustic features of social
   calls. Social clusters were significantly differentiated in their
   acoustic features, and the SVM classification accuracy was 60\%. These
   results indicate that vocal repertoire reflects social segregation in
   short-finned pilot whales and may be a driving mechanism of
   differentiation, potentially contributing to genetic diversity within
   populations. This suggests divergent acoustic population structure;
   however, the small sample size in this study decreases the ability to
   detect acoustic differences among groups. Additional sampling will
   improve our power to detect acoustic differences among social clusters
   of Hawaiian pilot whales and improve classification accuracy. The
   pattern described here highlights the importance of increasing the
   spatial and temporal resolution of conservation and management plans for
   this species, in order to conserve subpopulation genetic and social
   structure.Significance statementIn some species, vocal repertoires
   differ among social groups or populations of a species that use the same
   habitat. These differences, called dialects, are thought to be important
   to maintaining segregation among groups of animals with overlapping
   distributions, and in some cases may increase intra-specific ecological
   or genetic variability. This study is the first to provide evidence that
   sympatric social clusters of short-finned pilot whales have different
   vocal repertoires, and that vocal repertoire within groups may change
   with behavioral context. In terrestrial (e.g., elephants) and marine
   (e.g., killer whales, sperm whales) species with similarly stable social
   hierarchies, where acoustic dialects, genetic diversity, and/or
   ecological variability are linked with social structure, anthropogenic
   stressors have precipitated rapid declines in abundance with slow or
   nonexistent recovery. Given the myriad threats faced by short-finned
   pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, including fisheries bycatch,
   military and commercial anthropogenic noise, and vessel strikes,
   understanding intra-population social structure and its links with
   genetic structure and ecological variability is imperative to the proper
   conservation and management of this species.},

Title = {Species richness, rarity and endemicity on Italian offshore islands:
   complementary signals from island-focused and species-focused analyses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {664-674},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aims To investigate the relative explanatory power of source faunas and
   geographical variables for butterfly incidence, frequency, richness,
   rarity, and endemicity on offshore islands.
   Location The western Italian offshore islands ( Italy and Malta).
   Methods Thirty-one islands were examined. Data were taken from our own
   field surveys and from the literature. Two approaches were undertaken,
   described as island-focused and species-focused, respectively. Offshore
   islands were allocated to their neighbouring source landmasses ( Italian
   Peninsula, Sicily and Sardinia - Corsica) and compared with each other
   for faunal attributes, source and island geography. Generalized linear
   and stepwise multiple regression models were then used to determine the
   relationships of island species richness, rarity and endemicity with
   potential geographical predictors and source richness, rarity, and
   endemicity ( island-focused). Species frequency and incidence were
   assessed in relation to geographical and source predictors using
   stepwise linear and logistic regression, and inter-island associations
   were examined using K-Means clustering and non-metric scaling (
   species-focused).
   Results The analysis reveals firm evidence for the influence of the
   nearest large landmass sources on island species assemblages, richness,
   rarity and endemicity. A clear distinction in faunal affinities occurs
   between the Sardinian islands and islands lying offshore from the
   Italian mainland and Sicily. Islands neighbouring these three distinct
   sources differ significantly in richness, rarity and endemicity. Source
   richness, rarity, and endemicity have explanatory power for island
   richness, rarity, and endemicity, respectively, and together with island
   geography account for a substantial part of the variation in island
   faunas ( richness 59\%, rarity 60\% and endemicity 64\%). Source
   dominates the logistic regression parameters predicting the incidence of
   island species {[} 13 ( 38\%) of 34 species that could be analysed];
   three ecological factors ( source frequency, flight period and maximal
   altitude at which species live) explained 75\% of the variation in the
   occurrence of species on the islands. Species found more frequently on
   islands occurred more frequently at sources, had longer flight periods,
   and occurred at lower altitudes at the sources. The incidence of most
   species on islands ( 84\%) is correctly predicted by the same three
   variables.
   Main conclusions The Italian region of the Mediterranean Sea has a rich
   butterfly fauna comprising endemics and rare species as well as more
   cosmopolitan species. Analysis of island records benefited from the use
   of two distinct approaches, namely island-focused and species-focused,
   that sift distinct elements in island and source faunas. Clear
   contemporary signals appear in island - source relationships as well as
   historical signals. Differences among faunas relating to sources within
   the same region caution against assuming that contemporary ( ecological)
   and historical ( evolutionary) influences affect faunas of islands in
   different parts of the same region to the same extent. The implications
   of source - island relationships for the conservation of butterflies
   within the Italian region are considered, particularly for the long-term
   persistence of species.},

Title = {A framework to guide the conservation of species hybrids based on
   ethical and ecological considerations},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1040-1051},

Abstract = {Species hybrids have long been undervalued in conservation and are often
   perceived as a threat to pure species. Recently, the conservation value
   of hybrids, especially those of natural origin, has gained recognition;
   however, hybrid conservation remains controversial. We reviewed hybrid
   management policies, including laws, regulations, and management
   protocols, from a variety of organizations, primarily in Canada and the
   United States. We found that many policies are based on limited ethical
   and ecological considerations and provide little opportunity for hybrid
   conservation. In most policies, hybrids are either unrepresented or
   considered a threat to conservation goals. This is problematic because
   our review of the hybrid conservation literature identified many ethical
   and ecological considerations relevant to determining the conservation
   value of a hybrid, all of which are management-context specific. We also
   noted a lack of discussion of the ethical considerations regarding
   hybrid conservation. Based on these findings, we created a policy
   framework outlining situations in which hybrids could be eligible for
   conservation in Canada and the United States. The framework comprises a
   decision tree that helps users determine whether a hybrid should be
   eligible for conservation based on multiple ecological and ethical
   considerations. The framework may be applied to any hybrid and is
   flexible in that it accommodates context-specific management by allowing
   different options if a hybrid is a threat to or could benefit
   conservation goals. The framework can inform policy makers and
   conservationists in decision-making processes regarding hybrid
   conservation by providing a systematic set of decision criteria and
   guidance on additional criteria to be considered in cases of
   uncertainty, and it fills a policy gap that limits current hybrid
   management.
   Un Marco de Referencia para Guiar a la Conservacion de Hibridos de
   Especies con base en Consideraciones Eticas y Ecologicas Jackiw et al.
   12526 Los hibridos de especies han sido subvalorados en la conservacion
   durante mucho tiempo y frecuentemente se perciben como una amenaza para
   las especies puras. Recientemente, el valor de conservacion de los
   hibridos, especialmente aquellos de origen natural, ha ganado
   reconocimiento; sin embargo, la conservacion de hibridos sigue siendo
   controversial. Revisamos las politicas de manejo de hibridos de una
   variedad de organizaciones, principalmente en Canada y en los Estados
   Unidos, incluyendo las leyes, regulaciones y protocolos de manejo.
   Encontramos que muchas politicas se basan en consideraciones eticas y
   ecologicas limitadas y proporcionan pocas oportunidades para la
   conservacion de hibridos. En la mayoria de las politicas, los hibridos
   estan mal representados o se consideran una amenaza para los objetivos
   de conservacion. Esto es problematico porque nuestra revision de la
   literatura sobre la conservacion de hibridos identifico muchas
   consideraciones eticas y ecologicas relevantes para la determinacion del
   valor de conservacion de un hibrido, de las cuales todas son especificas
   para el manejo de contexto especifico. Tambien notamos una falta de
   discusion sobre las consideraciones eticas con respecto a la
   conservacion de hibridos. Con base en estos hallazgos, creamos un marco
   de referencia politico que resalta situaciones en las que los hibridos
   pueden ser elegibles para la conservacion en Canada y en los Estados
   Unidos. El marco de referencia consta de un arbol de decision que ayuda
   a los usuarios a determinar si un hibrido debe ser elegible para la
   conservacion con base en multiples consideraciones eticas y ecologicas.
   El marco de referencia puede aplicarse a cualquier hibrido y es
   flexible, ya que acomoda el manejo de contexto especifico al permitir
   diferentes opciones si un hibrido es una amenaza o si podria beneficiar
   a los objetivos de conservacion. El marco de referencia puede informar a
   quienes hacen las politicas y a los conservacionistas sobre los procesos
   de toma de decisiones con respecto a la conservacion de hibridos al
   proporcionar un conjunto sistematico de criterios de decision y una guia
   de los criterios adicionales a ser considerados en casos de
   incertidumbre y llena un vacio politico que limita al manejo actual de
   los hibridos.
